2,51. C'era Una Volta Il West,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0064116,Operatic,"This might be the best spaghetti western I've seen. It opens with all the things we've now grown to expect from them 3 men and their ugly, sweaty, bearded weathered faces, with greasy hair and the sweat shinning off them, this is not a romantic west at all, but a dirty and violent place but one with great style and flair too. The cinematography is really great in this film, it lends it an operatic quality as does the music, the camera is able to glide through and above the characters. The Blu Ray transfer is excellent, it's a widescreen movie and one that avoids lots of bold primary colours in favour of a more worn out look. It still has a few flaws, the obvious dubbing, the cartoony sound effects when people are punched but generally this is a really stylish film, the humour if there is any is very subtle, all the characters have a certain mystery to them, we don't know them and they don't really know each other. Character introductions are handled really well, they really announce themselves, one character is so mysterious we don't even know his name and neither does anyone else apparently. He just sits in the corner of the bar and plays his harmonica, the music from it and even the sound of trains breaking is mixed into the soundtrack so well. The plot is a bit convoluted and messy at times, half way through one character has to spend about 2 minutes of exposition explaining what's happening and how he saw it all in a document, they were probably aware the audience would be getting lost by that point. There's a scene early on which is simply horrific and is a complete shocker, it's a shame though it's largely forgotten about towards the end among all the characters. For me though it's still haunting and done with practically no music. As ever the source of all the hurt and suffering and death is greed, greed over money, greed over land, the country wasn't build by purely noble spirits the film seems to be telling us. The ending though really works, it goes on but I found all of that last bit very satisfying. There's still a little bit of the old romantic left in the spaghetti western too, and this film has it. Directed by an Italian and filmed in the USA it's almost like an opera, it's that personal and epic. The film does borrow from others but it does it in it's own unique style. Thoroughly entertaining and thrilling.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9516526/?ref_=tt_urv
3,55. Django Unchained,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1853728,Wonderful Tarantino western,"Tarantino has always payed homage to classic cult films and spagetthi westerns throughout his ever impressive career, so it was only a matter of time until he mae a full fledged western - and does so to exception.This is indeed one of his more acclaimed and better films, attested to by its numerous awards, and spot on IMDb's prestigious Top 250 list. It has a lot going for it, and surely delivers as a great masterpiece.It fully embraces its genre gracefully, whilst adding its own unique Tarantino flair of dark comedy and satire across the adventure feeling. All of it splendidly conveyed, wondeful acting from everyone of the legendary cast, and incredible, unique cinematography.Overall, definitely a highlight of Tarantino's, and very much one of his best films. One that is ever recommended, but I would expect most have seen it already!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530123/?ref_=tt_urv
4,127. Per qualche dollaro in pi√π,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0059578,The man with no name is back.,"This is a film about two bounty hunters whose paths cross one day way back in the old west. The film holds onto a few features of it's previous one, the grainy look, the bad dubbing, the frayed and worn costumes, the low and interesting camera angles, another great introduction to Eastwood's character who this time enters a saloon on a rainy night to retrieve his prize, he's a cold and detached character who doesn't mind blowing a few men away to get rich. The punch effects are still over the top like someone breaking a table in half or something, the film retains though a real rough unpolished look which combines well with it's stylish music and action. The music is good in this one again and there's even a little organ music too which surprised me. The film is still low budget but I loved the costumes, the landscape and the dry humour in the film. The picture is widescreen and the blu ray comes with good picture and sound quality. Eastwood continues to fascinate as this tall handsome strange man with no past. This is not a gory film, in fact some characters are shot dead at point blank range with no blood. Eastwood sort of takes a bit of a backseat in this film though, Lee Van Cleef is really great in his role and the one they end up going after together is a real villain. There is one scene though that's really poor where a woman who's being attacked by a man in bed shoots herself when she could quite easily have killed him instead which you think might have been more likely but there you go. I have go give this film a lot of praise though for it's music, costumes, characters, landscapes, production design and direction. All in all very satisfying and an improvement over the first one.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9513809/?ref_=tt_urv
5,145. Unforgiven,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0105695,"""It's a hell of a thing killing a man......""","A brilliant work, brooding and dark, with slow pacing, excellent casting and acting and superb attention to production design and detail.The film in some ways lives up to the genre of the western with rugged, characters, raw masculinity, beautiful stark cinematography of plains, mountains and the unspoilt beauty of the mid West. Gene Hackman's little Bill is a man who projects raw power and toughness, he's so macho that he even builds his own house too. A man who likes to get his hands dirty then.Unforigven though is also a deconstruction of the western genre, with it's tropes, folklore and hearsay. The character English Bob serves not only as a warning of what can happen to unwelcome visitors to the town, he's also a character whose mystery and grandeur is gradually pulled away until a more humble character is left behind. The realism extends down to the weaponry the characters use, bullets often miss their mark & guns are prone to jam.There's lots of character development but the story is almost the opposite of a redemption story. The plot isn't based around personal revenge or anything like that either for our 3 killers, they're doing it for the money and that's it. Clint Eastwood's characters instance that he'll be able to carry out his mission without reverting back to his nasty old self is very much thrown into doubt. The film in the end is about brutality and the horrific effect violence takes on the human life.On the technical side the film is superbly shot and directed. Sound design is superb and dialogue is clear and stands apart from the score. Much of the film takes place in dark interiors reflecting the reality of life back then, there were no 40 watt light bulbs in the evening. Daylight scenes are clear though and add a harsh reality to the landscape. I own the UHD Blu Ray 2160p and was really impressed with the high quality picture and sound.Only flaw is the Eastwood character suddenly developing this plot armour at the end of the movie which really spoils the realism they were going for up to that point. As others have pointed out too this is hardly the first revisionist western either.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523769/?ref_=tt_urv
6,148. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0040897,Mistrust and greed i,"A pretty good film. Shot in 4:3 black and white and released in 1948 the story is a warning about greed and the violence and mental harm it can induce. Bogart stars as a down on his luck man who teams up with two other men hoping to strike it rich in Mexico mining for gold. The film is nicely edited, it has great costumes, I think it's misleading to describe it as a western. The sense of isolation is nicely done, when another man turns up it's clear he's not welcome, the camp fire scenes are well done and the hot dusty rocky landscape gives the film plenty of heat and grit. The film portrays a nice sense of paranoia but I found there's a lot of scenes of just dialogue which don't really add a lot and are something you just have to sit through. The film is a PG but children will not be engaged, it's only for adults really, the cinematography is nice and the attention to detail like how dishevelled and bearded the men become. Mistrust and greed is a strong theme.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522566/?ref_=tt_urv
7,189. The Gold Rush,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0015864,Raw Screenplay and Fine Slapstick Comedy,Charlie Chaplin had so many great sketches of comedic gags. He was a pioneering screenplay comedian.Acting is superb. It's all on the visuals as obviously there's no audio apart from the fabulous piano score.It's an emotive story about prospectors set in the good ol' USA at a time when the man who obtained gold got rich and was the envy of his peers.Sadly people still think that today and equity and capitalism are the envy now when there's much more to life. Do people learn?I love the desperation of the actors and the infighting. The slapstick is just excellent. The way Chaplin provokes the audience for gags and laughs is divine. A sensational talent.A classic movie. Please watch. So many acting lessons on show.,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9433148/?ref_=tt_urv
8,250. Dances with Wolves,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0099348,A magnificent looking fellow,"To put it simply this is just the greatest movie I've ever seen! Kevin Costner excels here both in directing and acting not just recreating the great characters from Micheal Blake's book but clearly giving us the atmosphere and feel of it too!His performance is just great and the way his character develops is just a treat to watch
Everything about the movie is perfect! It all fits together like a jigsaw puzzle with John Barry's music like a fabulous cherry on top.You can just feel the characters as if you know them! And the sadness cuts deeps and highs feel great! It's just so damn good!Every damn shot is like a painting! And as an artist I love to paint emIn all a piece of perfection
Not a damn thing you could do to make it any better!Kevin is a hero the world of cinema.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9513850/?ref_=tt_urv
