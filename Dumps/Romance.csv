and inspiration. To meld all these qualities together is no mean feat. It works a great here. The central performance is unforgettable and he deserved his Oscar. A great soundtrack throughout. The support cast is also excellent inc Gary sinise sally field and Robin wright. It would be easy to nit pick certain things but in the realm of what this film is trying to do it doesn't matter. The most significant thing this film offers is that you feel. And you can't not. It's those indelible moments throughout that make this a masterpiece. You feel sad but at the same time you feel hope. A wonderful ending with the feather echoing both the ideas of destiny and also not knowing what's coming. A great film.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9532001/?ref_=tt_urv

Life Is Beautiful,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0118799,The poignant and heart-wrenching film,"""Life Is Beautiful"" is a poignant and heart-wrenching film that navigates the resilience of the human spirit amidst the darkest of circumstances. Directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, this masterpiece effortlessly blends humor, love, and tragedy against the backdrop of World War II.The story revolves around Guido, a charming and optimistic Jewish man, who uses his wit and humor to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration camp. With unwavering determination, Guido turns their internment into a game, creating an elaborate ruse to protect his son and shield him from the brutal realities of their situation.What sets ""Life Is Beautiful"" apart is its ability to find light in the midst of darkness, using humor and love as a form of resistance against the cruelty of war.

Either way, I am not going to argue with people who consider this a masterpiece or as their favorite film, because this film definitely is a masterpiece. Though I do wish Rick and Ilsa had their happy ending with each other, this does remind me that one of the most important things about loves is that the woman is as safe as possible in any situation or circumstance.

7,53. City Lights,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0021749,A Silent Masterpiece. A Contender For Chaplin's Best Film.,"In regards to silent cinema, the first name that usually comes to mind is usually a tossup between either Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, who in their own rights, were both masters in their field, as they both created some of the best and most well-known films in the history of cinema. As for what I would say is my favorite of Chaplin's films, it would probably be this one, as it's a film that could not possibly be any better than it is, it's perfect in every conceivable aspect.City Lights is a flawless film that may very well be the best thing that Charlie Chaplin made. The film is funny, heartwarming, and filled with a sense of pathos. More specifically, the movie contains trademark Chaplin comedy, as the funny scenes are genuinely funny and are certain to make the audience laugh, however, the dramatic moments are indeed dramatic, which showed that Chaplin could be extremely versatile in his abilities as a filmmaker, one who was capable of bringing out the laughter and the feels.The film stars Chaplin as his iconic persona as The Tramp. In this film, the Tramp meets this young flower girl that he falls in love with, and, upon discovering that she's unable to see, becomes determined to help her. Eventually, he crosses paths with a millionaire, and this may potentially lead to him reaching his goal. Throughout the course of the film, plenty of hilarious moments ensue, while at the same time, so does quite a bit of the aforementioned sense of pathos, which combine to make what one might consider to be one of the most beautiful films ever made, and probably the finest of Chaplin's career.Chaplin's Tramp character is much like the other films that said persona appeared in, he's the average individual who gets caught up in situations, both funny and dramatic. Some of the funny moments include the beginning where he gets entangled on a statue and has a hard time trying to get down. There's also a scene where he gets a job as a street cleaner, and tries to wash his hands while one of his co-workers is trying to make a sandwich, which results in the co-worker accidentally eating a bar of soap. Then there's also the hilarity of one of the most famous scenes in the film, a boxing match in which the Tramp competes in to win money to help the aforementioned blind girl, a match that doesn't go according to plan. However, like I also said, there are some more dramatic moments to them, which as I also said before, showcases Chaplin's versatility.In addition to Chaplin, there's also some great supporting performances. Among said roles include Harry Myers, who plays the millionaire who becomes friends (well, depending on what frame of mind he's in) with the Tramp, and even becomes something of an assistant to him in is mission to help the girl he loves. However, the best one after Chaplin would have to be Virginia Cherrill, who plays the blind girl that Chaplin becomes determined to help. Their interactions with each other are probably among the most touching I've seen in any movie, because even though they have problems understanding each other due to the girl's blindness, one can still feel a sense of compassion amongst the two, which leads to one of the most heartwarming endings in cinema. The ending of the film (and I won't say what it is), which has been talked about for decades, is one that will definitely move the audience (if not more).Ultimately, City Lights is a breathtaking, funny, and very moving experience that definitely has a tendency to captivate those who view it. While I definitely would recommend this masterpiece to those who have yet to see it, I would not recommend it if they're discovering silent films for the first time, because while the film is outstanding, the sense of pathos might prove to be too much for first time silent film viewers. If that's the case, then some of the films of Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd would be perfect for entering the silent foray, and if that proves to work, then give Chaplin a try, as his movies are among the finest of all time. Some might debate that there are better films that Chaplin made, while at the same time, there are probably those who would say that this is his best, which is a sentiment that I can definitely agree with. If you see this film, and you end up being entranced by it, then you've seen one of the best movies from the era, and it would also be no overestimation to say that it's one of the best films of all time.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534036/?ref_=tt_urv

Good Will Hunting,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0119217,Could have been a contender,"Okay, okay, I'm going to get downvoted for this, but I think, and it's not be being prudish at all, the excessive and gratuitous swearing that really takes away the quality from Good Will Hunting. The storyline was inspirational and Matt Damon displayed his acting and writing chops, but I remember when I left the cinema, afterwards a couple of friends, who weren't prudish for sure, also were dismayed by the swearing non-stop and gratuitous.Anyway, good to see the late Robin Williams winning a well-deserved Oscar. Good Will Hunting pretty much Boston on the map again although I don't think Ben Affleck and Matt Damon really had strong Bostonian accents.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539042/?ref_=tt_urv

I can probably vote that my favorite types of storylines are love stories now, and this will be because every love story I have ever witnessed had some beautiful storytelling and astonishing character development. This would mean that Don and Kathy's dynamic in this film was definitely one of the greatest in any film ever, and that is an absolute fact.

It's not easy to narrate such a story and plot using limited equipements, moving from one time to another, but it was beautifully presented and you could easily understand when and how things happened.It is very enjoyable and every scene is important, you cannot miss one. And I love the plot twist, how it began from the ending, and how different you see them now even if you already watched the scene before.What I loved the most is the concept and idea behind it. It can be interpreted in different ways but what I felt just really hit me.Love is beautiful. It is painfully beautiful. You fall in love with someone, but the process of falling in love is what makes it special. You discover yourself, what you like, what you hate. You change, maybe for the worse but it doesn't matter, because you're living the best time of your life, experiencing love again. You might go through hell or not know what you're doing in a relationship, but love is the only beautiful thing in relationships, because everyone is f up and lost.I loved the ending, when they both knew and were sure of how their relationship ended, however they still wanted to be together and do it all over again, they still wanted to fall for each other, they still wanted pain for the sake of love, because it's worth it.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537569/?ref_=tt_urv
12,99. The Apartment,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0053604,Always follow what your gut tells you!,"I begin by expressing my profound admiration for the 1960s, a decade that holds a special place in my heart, particularly in the realm of cinema. The 60s witnessed monumental events, both on Earth and beyond, and two instances that stand out are Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's historic walk on the Moon during the Cold War-era Space Race and the groundbreaking contributions of filmmaker Billy Wilder.Drawing a parallel between these significant milestones, I find a compelling analogy between Wilder's film ""The Apartment"" and Armstrong's first steps on the lunar surface. In the world of cinema, ""The Apartment"" marked a revolutionary moment for Wilder, akin to Armstrong's historic lunar walk. It served as a catalyst, sparking a cinematic revolution that reverberated through subsequent works.While Wilder's filmography of the 60s includes notable works like ""One, Two, Three"" (1961), ""Irma la Douce"" (1963), and ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" (1964), it is undeniable that ""The Apartment"" was the genesis of his cinematic journey during that era. The film laid the foundation for Wilder's distinctive style and narrative prowess, setting the stage for the subsequent masterpieces that followed.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539645/?ref_=tt_urv
13,103. Vertigo,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0052357,"Groundbreaking themes, visuals in this moody classic thriller","I recently watched the restored version of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" The plot, which has some puzzling holes, follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) as a retired San Francisco police detective who grapples with crippling acrophobia, vertigo and guilt after a rooftop chase of a suspect results in a fellow cop's death. Scottie spends time with his ex-fiancee and best buddy, Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes in a very underrated performance), an independent, successful commercial artist who still pines for him.With little to do with his time, Scottie takes on a private eye gig to follow the gorgeous young wife of a wealthy college chum, Gavin Elster, who has suspicions about what she's doing all day long. It appears that the young, glamorous Madeleine (Kim Novak) is obsessed with her dead great-grandmother, Carlotta, who committed suicide and became an old San Francisco legend. Scottie follows Madeleine as she visits Carlotta's grave at a picturesque Spanish mission churchyard and her portrait in the museum. Naturally, Scottie falls madly in love with the ethereal, elegant and haunted Madeleine, and becomes obsessed with her, with disastrous results all around.""Vertigo"" explores mental illness, obsession and the dark, destructive side of sexual attraction. Scottie's phobias (fear of heights and fear of falling) and his vertigo are major plot elements, crippling him emotionally and cutting his career short -- in effect, emasculating him. He seems energized by his passion for Madeleine, but it actually clouds his judgment and causes him more pain.The elements that stood out for me were stylistic, especially Hitchcock's very deliberate manipulation of light and color. When Midge and Scottie visit a bookstore to ask the owner, a local historian, what he knows about Madeleine's ancestor, the lighting gradually darkens to the point where you can hardly see the three actors, then brightens again once they step outside, although at dusk. There is a famous shot of Kim Novak walking out of a hotel bathroom, perfectly dressed and coiffed, where she is bathed in eerie green light from the neon sign outside. The camera is placed from Scottie's viewpoint, and we sense that he has given himself over to his obsession and idealization of this woman. There is a wild, colorful, animated dream sequence which seems dated now, but at the time, would have been rather avant-garde.Hitchcock also made the most of the spectacular settings of 1950s San Francisco, with many of its striking landmarks (Coit Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Muir Woods, the Palace of the Legion of Honor) as sites for important plot twists. In a film about obsession, detachment from reality and dreams, San Francisco seems like a film set dreamed up by an artist, but of course, all these places are real.The plot has some serious holes, including the characters' motivations. You would have to overlook that and simply enjoy the languid beauty of the cinematography, and the exploration of obsession and other psychological themes.Also, Stewart's age was an issue for me in this role. Stewart looks too old to be a romantic partner for Novak in this film, although I thought they made a cute, quirky couple in the comedy ""Bell, Book and Candle,"" where he was a publishing executive -- more of a worldly, attractive figure than a San Fran cop who had to take early retirement because of his fear of heights and can't even buy you drinks at the Top of the Mark. He looks old enough to be retired from the police force because, well, he was at retirement age for a cop. He and Midge talk about how they had dated in college, but Midge looks much younger than him. In fact, Bel Geddes was 14 years younger than Stewart.The films of that era often paired young actresses with established male actors old enough to be their fathers, and it doesn't always resonate with modern audiences in my opinion. In some films, it makes more sense that the ""ingenue"" would fall for a powerful, wealthy and sophisticated older man, but in other films, it just feels a bit creepy. It works better if the script actually acknowledges the age difference.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9527703/?ref_=tt_urv

Stunning and exquisite cinematography, colors, clothing, environment, music, set, mood, everything about the movie. Except the plot/dialogue. Which bored me in the middle.This movie took me into another world. The setting and environment , is something else. I feel like i want to experience it someday. In Paris, with the vibrant colors, clothes, cafe, the neighborhood. Also the little details in the movie. Enjoyed this aspect of the movie.However, the story i didn't like. Except for the happy ending. The movie was scattered and random, you don't know where it's going to the point it feels like the story is pointless. A lot of unnecessary scenes and took a lot of random turns until you finally saw the big picture. She has something missing in her that she wanted to find, instead of helping others. Also a lot of contradictions, one time she's good one time she's revengeful another she's shy and another time she is not. Well, then she ""a kind hearted introvert"" wants to find love, she loves a person deeplu without knowing anything about him except that he works at a porn shop and does some nonsense (the picture booth). Sure. A lot of unrealistic stuff all around.Anyways, i did enjoy the movie but enjoyed the picturesque aspect of it more than the story.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9491278/?ref_=tt_urv
15,129. Some Like It Hot,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0053291,"Well, nobody's perfect! Perhaps Some Like It Hot is!?","Billy Wilders 1959 comedy ""Some Like it Hot"" will forever be an absolute masterpiece of comedic cinema. A wonderful cast starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and an astonishing Marilyn Monroe combined with Billy Wilders directing make this film a classic that will never be forgotten.The plot of two male musicians dressing up as women to escape the mob during the prohibition era in Chicago is in itself not only unique but also hilarious.However, as great as this film is in delivering laughs and entertainment, that is not all to it.Some Like It Hot shows how different people were treated by their gender and attractiveness. ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" (the two musicians female alter egos) are constantly being approached or even touched by men throughout the film.All in all, Billy Wilders classic is a great piece of comedic cinema, while it also makes one think about the differences between men and women in society.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9495136/?ref_=tt_urv
16,162. Gone with the Wind,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0031381,Enduring classic,"""Gone with the Wind"" stands as an enduring classic in cinematic history, and its timeless appeal is owed to its exceptional storytelling, compelling characters, and groundbreaking production.Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, the film unfolds with sweeping grandeur and meticulous attention to detail. Vivien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara is nothing short of iconic. Her performance is a masterclass in acting, navigating Scarlett's complex character arc with grace and depth. Leigh's ability to convey resilience, vulnerability, and determination adds immeasurable richness to the film.Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is the perfect foil to Leigh's Scarlett, creating an on-screen chemistry that sizzles with tension and passion. Gable's charismatic performance contributes to the film's enduring romantic allure, making Rhett Butler one of cinema's most memorable characters.The film's production values, particularly its cinematography and set design, were groundbreaking for its time. The sweeping landscapes and grandiose scenes are visually stunning, contributing to the epic scale of the narrative. Max Steiner's iconic musical score further enhances the emotional impact, creating a timeless soundscape that resonates through the ages.""Gone with the Wind"" is not just a film; it's a cinematic epic that has left an indelible mark on popular culture. Its exploration of love, loss, and resilience, set against the backdrop of a nation in turmoil, continues to captivate audiences. As a cinematic achievement, ""Gone with the Wind"" remains a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring magic of the silver screen.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9515459/?ref_=tt_urv

El Secreto De Sus Ojos,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1305806,The lack of consistency brings it down.,"This movie is like Marmite, you're going to love it or hate it, period, there is no in-between. The major problem of IMDb these days is the reviews are pretentious. This site has become the refuge of wannabe film critics who give 10s to anything 'not Marvel's, thinking they look smart doing so. But what's the deal with this movie? Well, for starters, the first hour feels very much like your standard modern Spanish / South American production. With fairly static shots, stiff acting and generic delivery.BUT for some reason that is absolutely beyond me, its second half kicks off with a shot I had to rewind to believe and even looked up on YouTube to understand how it was done, then it merges into some homage to Casablanca, then to the French classics, and finally it desaturates its color palette to the point where trees become gray. No explanation is given. It's either going to be seen as pure genius or absolutely demented. And that's what bothers me. It's an homage to the French classics, it nails the 80s feel, probably in a way that no other movie has ever done. But at the same time, we're treated to amateurish make-ups, and the aforementioned first hour which felt more like law and order than watching a real movie. Did the director of photography get fired mid shot? Is this all purpose? We will never know.If the symbolism had been better handled, (it is not exactly subtle) and the movie far more consistent visually,this could have been an absolute masterpiece. I felt like I watched half a film. And I can't even excuse it for being low budget or made by amateurs because it's none of these things.Puzzling but they are worse things you can watch.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9504600/?ref_=tt_urv

He was a pioneering screenplay comedian.Acting is superb. It's all on the visuals as obviously there's no audio apart from the fabulous piano score.It's an emotive story about prospectors set in the good ol' USA at a time when the man who obtained gold got rich and was the envy of his peers.Sadly people still think that today and equity and capitalism are the envy now when there's much more to life. Do people learn?I love the desperation of the actors and the infighting. The slapstick is just excellent. The way Chaplin provokes the audience for gags and laughs is divine. A sensational talent.A classic movie. Please watch. So many acting lessons on show.,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9433148/?ref_=tt_urv

Dr. BORG (Victor Sjostrom) a financially and professionally successful widower makes a car trip to receive a prize, but on this trip he ends up passing through places from his childhood and opening his eyes to the visions of the vivid memories he witnesses, his eternal beloved who currently married his brother, his mother and his son who alone treat the feeling of loneliness very deeply perhaps due to his selfishness and Dr. BORG can see all of this only after that day when he gives a ride to some people who, talking about life, opens it up to his eyes. His family picked wild strawberries as a child, but even so he could have had a name more closely linked to the protagonist. Director Ingamar Bergman's plans are the most psychological in the history of cinema, he has a quick dollie or zoom for important expressions of the character, but it is not comical like Quentin Tarantino's, always trying to cut as little as possible always brings a lot of reality and drama of the scenes.
