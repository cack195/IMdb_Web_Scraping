5,53. City Lights,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0021749,A Silent Masterpiece. A Contender For Chaplin's Best Film.,"In regards to silent cinema, the first name that usually comes to mind is usually a tossup between either Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin, who in their own rights, were both masters in their field, as they both created some of the best and most well-known films in the history of cinema. As for what I would say is my favorite of Chaplin's films, it would probably be this one, as it's a film that could not possibly be any better than it is, it's perfect in every conceivable aspect.City Lights is a flawless film that may very well be the best thing that Charlie Chaplin made. The film is funny, heartwarming, and filled with a sense of pathos. More specifically, the movie contains trademark Chaplin comedy, as the funny scenes are genuinely funny and are certain to make the audience laugh, however, the dramatic moments are indeed dramatic, which showed that Chaplin could be extremely versatile in his abilities as a filmmaker, one who was capable of bringing out the laughter and the feels.The film stars Chaplin as his iconic persona as The Tramp. In this film, the Tramp meets this young flower girl that he falls in love with, and, upon discovering that she's unable to see, becomes determined to help her. Eventually, he crosses paths with a millionaire, and this may potentially lead to him reaching his goal. Throughout the course of the film, plenty of hilarious moments ensue, while at the same time, so does quite a bit of the aforementioned sense of pathos, which combine to make what one might consider to be one of the most beautiful films ever made, and probably the finest of Chaplin's career.Chaplin's Tramp character is much like the other films that said persona appeared in, he's the average individual who gets caught up in situations, both funny and dramatic. Some of the funny moments include the beginning where he gets entangled on a statue and has a hard time trying to get down. There's also a scene where he gets a job as a street cleaner, and tries to wash his hands while one of his co-workers is trying to make a sandwich, which results in the co-worker accidentally eating a bar of soap. Then there's also the hilarity of one of the most famous scenes in the film, a boxing match in which the Tramp competes in to win money to help the aforementioned blind girl, a match that doesn't go according to plan. However, like I also said, there are some more dramatic moments to them, which as I also said before, showcases Chaplin's versatility.In addition to Chaplin, there's also some great supporting performances. Among said roles include Harry Myers, who plays the millionaire who becomes friends (well, depending on what frame of mind he's in) with the Tramp, and even becomes something of an assistant to him in is mission to help the girl he loves. However, the best one after Chaplin would have to be Virginia Cherrill, who plays the blind girl that Chaplin becomes determined to help. Their interactions with each other are probably among the most touching I've seen in any movie, because even though they have problems understanding each other due to the girl's blindness, one can still feel a sense of compassion amongst the two, which leads to one of the most heartwarming endings in cinema. The ending of the film (and I won't say what it is), which has been talked about for decades, is one that will definitely move the audience (if not more).Ultimately, City Lights is a breathtaking, funny, and very moving experience that definitely has a tendency to captivate those who view it. While I definitely would recommend this masterpiece to those who have yet to see it, I would not recommend it if they're discovering silent films for the first time, because while the film is outstanding, the sense of pathos might prove to be too much for first time silent film viewers. If that's the case, then some of the films of Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd would be perfect for entering the silent foray, and if that proves to work, then give Chaplin a try, as his movies are among the finest of all time. Some might debate that there are better films that Chaplin made, while at the same time, there are probably those who would say that this is his best, which is a sentiment that I can definitely agree with. If you see this film, and you end up being entranced by it, then you've seen one of the best movies from the era, and it would also be no overestimation to say that it's one of the best films of all time.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534036/?ref_=tt_urv
6,63. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt4633694,Decent but not amazing,Ok so I finally decided to watch the immensely popular spiderman animated films and while I like an occasional superhero film I don't adore them. Seeing how popular these films are and since I had watched the marvel spiderman films too I thought I should watch the animated films. I had high expectations for this seeing how well received it had been and I actually enjoyed it. The animation is refreshing and original and the story is interesting but overall I find it pretty average. It's a decent film but it's not amazing. I would recommend it though it isn't bad but just overhyped in my opinion.,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9528030/?ref_=tt_urv
7,66. The Great Dictator,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0032553,Biting satire on Fascist Europe.,"A great film from Chaplin. While still employing a little slapstick this is still a much modern film in some ways. A fair bit of the comedy comes from the dialogue which is very sharp and funny at times. The film continually mocks the Nazis as both mindless thugs committed to a ridiculous ideology which is right for ridicule. Paulette Goddard is wonderful in this movie and conveys so well the warmth and goodness so missing in many of her fellow humans. The production history of this film was quite interesting, I think the film is not without it's flaws, the way in which Chaplin feels the need to literally tell the audience everything that is right and wrong when until that point the film had done a better job at showing us. The scene of the globe has become especially iconic.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522105/?ref_=tt_urv
8,72. Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0057012,Genuine satire,"The great Stanley Kubrick was a surprisingly versatile director - during his brilliant career, he tried many genres and directions in cinema. The legendary film ""Doctor Strangelove"" is not only one of the most amazing comedies in the history of cinema, but also a very subtle and intelligent political satire, uncompromisingly ridiculing the entire political insanity of the ruling elite of the ""two nuclear superpowers.""In this film, Kubrick boldly addresses almost all pressing political issues. We are witnessing a real circus of freaks, in which the main clowns are: generals, politicians, ambassadors and, finally, leaders of governments. The plot of the film subsequently twists in such a dizzying spiral that one is left amazed at the skill of the great author, who managed to maintain style and taste without slipping into cheap shock value scenes. Stanley Kubrick brilliantly deconstructs the many archetypes of the Cold War. It is deconstructed in a very unbiased way. Each of the characters in the picture represents something. Kubrick seems to encrypt entertaining ideological agendas in his characters, delivering a harsh verdict on each of the opposing political systems.Truly one of the best political satires of the 20th century.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521006/?ref_=tt_urv
9,76. Toy Story,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114709,I love it.,"Brilliant story of friendship and imagination. I give this film high praise for the casting, performances and animation. Tom Hanks in particular is brilliant in this, I simply loved his voice acting for Woody. The film generated a huge amount of excitement and comment at the time due to it's amazing animation but for me it's the story which comes first. The music in the film is great and fits very well whatever see going on in the different scenes. The whole idea of the toys having to keep their lives a secret from the humans was very clever too. The film is just a brilliant tale of jealousy, lost identity and friendship, huge themes for a kids film but it's all pulled off with such skill. A brilliant movie.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523311/?ref_=tt_urv
10,85. 3 Idiots,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1187043,Must Watch,"""3 Idiots"" is a cinematic gem that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster while simultaneously provoking deep thoughts on the education system and societal expectations. Directed by Rajkumar Hirani, this 2009 Indian comedy-drama has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its brilliant storytelling, stellar performances, and profound messages.Set against the backdrop of an elite engineering institute in India, the film follows the journey of three friends, Rancho (played by Aamir Khan), Farhan (R. Madhavan), and Raju (Sharman Joshi). ""3 Idiots"" seamlessly blends humor, drama, and social commentary, making it a unique and unforgettable cinematic experience.The screenplay, penned by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi, is a masterpiece in itself. It ingeniously weaves together the past and present, creating a narrative that keeps you engrossed from start to finish. The dialogues are witty, thought-provoking, and often laced with humor, making the film simultaneously entertaining and insightful.Aamir Khan's portrayal of Rancho is a standout performance, showcasing his versatility as an actor. He effortlessly brings life to the character, infusing it with charm, intelligence, and a rebellious spirit. The chemistry between the three lead actors is palpable, their camaraderie adding depth to the story. R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi deliver commendable performances, perfectly balancing the comedic and emotional aspects of their roles.""3 Idiots"" tackles pressing issues in the education system, highlighting the obsession with grades, rote learning, and the lack of emphasis on true learning and individuality. The film encourages viewers to question societal norms and follow their passions, rather than succumbing to societal pressures. It presents a strong case for reevaluating the purpose of education, urging us to prioritize knowledge, creativity, and happiness over mere academic excellence.The film's cinematography and production design are top-notch. The picturesque landscapes of Ladakh and Shimla serve as breathtaking backdrops, enhancing the visual appeal of the narrative. The music by Shantanu Moitra is soul-stirring and perfectly complements the storytelling. Songs like ""Give Me Some Sunshine"" and ""All is Well"" have become anthems.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538954/?ref_=tt_urv

The music was awesome in this film, and the way that they ended it was absolutely, without a doubt, perfection. I can probably vote that my favorite types of storylines are love stories now, and this will be because every love story I have ever witnessed had some beautiful storytelling and astonishing character development. This would mean that Don and Kathy's dynamic in this film was definitely one of the greatest in any film ever, and that is an absolute fact. As of right now, I will have to put this in my top 10, if not 5, favorite films of all time. Good job to Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521261/?ref_=tt_urv

The animation of the humans has improved remarkably too since the original. The film is full of fun, action and some genuinely touching moments that leave a lump in the front. Though it has lots of entertainment for children this is a film that adults can really appreciate too. The film had me and the rest of my family in stiches at times. The Ken and Barbie storyline in particular was utterly brilliant. I really wish the storyline had ended here because it was the perfect point to end on.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523227/?ref_=tt_urv
13,99. The Apartment,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0053604,Always follow what your gut tells you!,"I begin by expressing my profound admiration for the 1960s, a decade that holds a special place in my heart, particularly in the realm of cinema. The 60s witnessed monumental events, both on Earth and beyond, and two instances that stand out are Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin's historic walk on the Moon during the Cold War-era Space Race and the groundbreaking contributions of filmmaker Billy Wilder.Drawing a parallel between these significant milestones, I find a compelling analogy between Wilder's film ""The Apartment"" and Armstrong's first steps on the lunar surface. In the world of cinema, ""The Apartment"" marked a revolutionary moment for Wilder, akin to Armstrong's historic lunar walk. It served as a catalyst, sparking a cinematic revolution that reverberated through subsequent works.While Wilder's filmography of the 60s includes notable works like ""One, Two, Three"" (1961), ""Irma la Douce"" (1963), and ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" (1964), it is undeniable that ""The Apartment"" was the genesis of his cinematic journey during that era. The film laid the foundation for Wilder's distinctive style and narrative prowess, setting the stage for the subsequent masterpieces that followed.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539645/?ref_=tt_urv
14,106. Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0211915,Colorful and vibrant and charming!!!,"I have mixed feeling about Amelie. Stunning and exquisite cinematography, colors, clothing, environment, music, set, mood, everything about the movie. Except the plot/dialogue. Which bored me in the middle.This movie took me into another world. The setting and environment , is something else. I feel like i want to experience it someday. In Paris, with the vibrant colors, clothes, cafe, the neighborhood. Also the little details in the movie. Enjoyed this aspect of the movie.However, the story i didn't like. Except for the happy ending. The movie was scattered and random, you don't know where it's going to the point it feels like the story is pointless. A lot of unnecessary scenes and took a lot of random turns until you finally saw the big picture. She has something missing in her that she wanted to find, instead of helping others. Also a lot of contradictions, one time she's good one time she's revengeful another she's shy and another time she is not. Well, then she ""a kind hearted introvert"" wants to find love, she loves a person deeplu without knowing anything about him except that he works at a porn shop and does some nonsense (the picture booth). Sure. A lot of unrealistic stuff all around.Anyways, i did enjoy the movie but enjoyed the picturesque aspect of it more than the story.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9491278/?ref_=tt_urv
15,111. Up,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1049413,"A beautiful, creative and wonderfully written story.","This movie is perfect in so many ways. First of all, it made me cry within the first 10 minutes which I think is an almost impossible feat by a simple movie. It shows me a beautiful bond by two people and then proceeds to reference it constantly throughout the movie reminding me of the past (a good thing) this movie has incredible storytelling and a clever twist. It is a very wild plot, but we are settled into it so amazingly. Soon enough we are watching several hundred dogs chase a man with a floating house, a Boy Scout, a talking dog and a mysterious random bird. And the leader of these dogs is a man gone rogue/crazy who was once the idol of Carl and Ellie. I find that Russell confides in Carl because he never had a proper father figure. And Carl loves Russell deeply because he never got to have children of his own. The villain is one of the most creative I've ever seen. He was an idol. They bonded over him and fell in love. But when they finally meet him he is a crazy mean guy who kills for fortune. This movie makes me cry for sadness and happiness. Carl goes crazy trying to complete the one goal him and Ellie had. But he has to learn to move on and that love is in the moment. We can look on the last but we must love who we have now and where we are. I think one of the most important moments in this movie is when Carl sits down in his newly placed home, completely alone, and he reflects on ""The adventure book"" that Ellie made. Further proof that he only thinks about what he wants and how to replicate what he had. But he never looked past the ""things I'm going to do"" part. Because it had pictures of him and Ellie all through it. And at the end it has a note form Ellie. ""Thanks for the adventure - now go have a new one!"" This made me ball my eyes out. This could not be more of a sign that the real Ellie wouldn't want him to pursue their goals, but would want him to continue on with his life and have new adventures. Beautiful. And the book changed him so much that he threw out a bunch of chairs and photos and memorabilia from his and Ellie's life. Showing us that he had moved on. INCREDIBLE. And then the cherry on top, his house floats away and it symbolises him moving on from Ellie. THEN CARL GOES TO HIS CEREMONY AND GIVES HIM ELLIES GRAPE SODA PIN I CANT. This is a brilliant movie and like it or not, it's better than onward. MADE ME CRY SO HARD. (I wrote this in my diary and I decided the world of IMDB needed to hear it.)",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9503711/?ref_=tt_urv
16,113. The Sting,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0070735,All it takes is a little confidence,"I honestly did not know about this movie until it was recommended to me, and by then I only knew about it being about grifters/con artists starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford; after watching this old 70s movie, I will say I can see why it was recommended to me, because it is a well-made movie that is meant to like it is from the 30s. The 70s movie The Sting (1973) is a well-made and well-acted movie that is nicely shot cinematography wise and can be occasionally funny; the movie mostly hangs on some suspense of the lead two characters succeeding at their con, and it is effective on how it is shown and how it is executed with them making smart decisions.Johnny Hooker and Henry Gondorff, played by Robert Redford and Paul Newman, work well together with Henry Gondorff being a professional when it comes to being a con, and Johnny Hooker is avoiding trouble after doing an average con to a crime boss leading to him conning the person again instead this time without him knowing; seeing both Johnny Hooker and Henry Gondorff working together to con this crime boss is entertaining how they put together their plan and execute it. I am on the main character's side the whole time, making them very entertaining to watch and you want them to achieve their goal of conning this person by lying and tricking him on multiple occasions.There is suspense in certain moments involving the person they are conning trying to figure them out, and when there are chase scenes, they are well shot and entertaining to watch seeing Johnny Hooker avoid this crime boss and his henchmen who are trying to kill him. The movie is nicely shot with nice long takes, and there are interesting transitions from scene to scene; the movie is split into different sections to build up to the ultimate con the characters are trying to succeed at. Also, though the movie came out in the 70s, the movie did feel like it was from the 30s, since that is the point in time the movie takes place in.The Sting (1973) is a well-made and well-acted movie that is nicely shot cinematography wise and can be occasionally funny; I know people who will think this movie is slow or boring, but the buildup to the con is entertaining with characters working well together and occasionally being funny when the movie wants them to be. I know lots of people like this movie, because of the actors and the year it came out, including it being about con artists; I liked it too and would also recommend it to those who have not seen the movie.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535852/?ref_=tt_urv
17,120. Snatch,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0208092,"A Riveting Blend of Crime, Comedy and Chaos","Snatch, directed by Guy Ritchie, is an exhilarating cinematic ride that seamlessly blends dark humour, intricate storytelling and dynamic characters. The film's non-linear narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat, creating a thrilling and unpredictable viewing experience. The ensemble cast, featuring standout performances from Jason Statham, Brad Pitt and others, adds layers of charisma to the already rich plot.Ritchie's signature style, characterised by sharp editing, witty dialogue and stylish visuals, is on full display in Snatch. The film's quirky and memorable characters, coupled with its clever use of humour, contribute to its cult status. The fast-paced, multi-layered narrative weaves together various storylines, creating a complex yet highly entertaining mosaic of crime and chaos.Snatch stands out not only for its compelling storytelling but also for its unique soundtrack, perfectly complementing the film's energetic and unpredictable atmosphere.

Perhaps Some Like It Hot is!?","Billy Wilders 1959 comedy ""Some Like it Hot"" will forever be an absolute masterpiece of comedic cinema. A wonderful cast starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and an astonishing Marilyn Monroe combined with Billy Wilders directing make this film a classic that will never be forgotten.The plot of two male musicians dressing up as women to escape the mob during the prohibition era in Chicago is in itself not only unique but also hilarious.However, as great as this film is in delivering laughs and entertainment, that is not all to it.Some Like It Hot shows how different people were treated by their gender and attractiveness. ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" (the two musicians female alter egos) are constantly being approached or even touched by men throughout the film.All in all, Billy Wilders classic is a great piece of comedic cinema, while it also makes one think about the differences between men and women in society.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9495136/?ref_=tt_urv

The Wolf of Wall Street,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0993846,Hilariously great,"(9.5 but rounding up) The comedy The Wolf of Wall Street is a hilarious movie that has me laughing every second. Jordan Belfort, protagonist played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a young stock broker in wall street. As he starts working and making a name for himself and learning the in and outs of the stock market he meets Donnie Azzoff, best friend played by Jonah Hill, and together they start their own Stock broking business. I was surprised about how funny this movie would be. Originally I believed it would be mostly informing and explaining a lot about the stock market but it really showed that their is not that much to know. It showed many behind the scenes moments regarding the stock market and the luck behind it. Overall one of the best movies I've ever seen with great actors and comedy.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537033/?ref_=tt_urv

""A picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear."" is the way it's introduced. The cast is small, the story is well focused and the ending was perfect. The picture quality from this DVD was good and sound quality was excellent. All the characters introduced fully pay off at the end which was highly satisfying. The low number of frames a second give it a slightly jilting quality which in this case aids the physical comedy.On a side note I found that the social message from this film to still be highly relevant, in an age where society still tends to blame poor people for being in poverty.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522259/?ref_=tt_urv
