2,52. Alien,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0078748,Alien (1979): A Sci-Fi Masterpiece That Still Sends Shivers - A Must Watch Classic!,"Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, is a timeless science fiction gem that continues to captivate audiences even decades after its release. This film stands as a testament to the brilliance of the genre, delivering an intense and thrilling experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat.The headline ""A Must-Watch Classic!"" perfectly encapsulates the impact and significance of Alien in the cinematic landscape. This movie is a pioneer in the science fiction genre, setting a benchmark for the countless films that followed. Its influence can still be felt in today's science fiction offerings.The film's strength lies in its ability to create an atmosphere of unrelenting tension. From the moment the crew of the Nostromo sets foot on the eerie planet, the sense of impending doom is palpable. Ridley Scott masterfully builds suspense, using every dark corner, creaking sound, and haunting score to keep the audience gripped throughout.One of the most iconic aspects of Alien is undoubtedly the creature design. H. R. Giger's nightmarish creation, the xenomorph, remains one of the most terrifying and visually striking creatures ever put on screen. Its sleek, biomechanical appearance combined with its relentless pursuit of the crew members creates an unforgettable antagonist that has become a staple in pop culture.The cast of Alien is also worth praising, with Sigourney Weaver delivering a career-defining performance as the resourceful and determined Ellen Ripley. Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is a trailblazing representation of a strong female lead in a genre that was often dominated by men. The supporting cast, including Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Ian Holm, all contribute to the film's authenticity and emotional depth.Furthermore, the film's practical effects and set designs are nothing short of exceptional. The claustrophobic interiors of the Nostromo and the eerie alien spaceship feel lived-in and believable, immersing the audience in this dystopian future. This attention to detail enhances the overall experience, making every moment feel genuine and impactful.While some may argue that the film's pacing is slow at times, it is precisely this deliberate pacing that allows the tension to simmer and build to a crescendo. Alien is not just about the scares; it is a thought-provoking exploration of humanity's vulnerability in the face of the unknown, the horrors that lurk in the darkness, and the strength of the human spirit when faced with unimaginable danger.In addition to its masterful storytelling and technical achievements, Alien also delves into deeper themes and subtext. It explores the concept of corporate greed and the exploitation of workers, serving as a critique of capitalism and the devaluation of human life in the pursuit of profit. These underlying themes elevate the film beyond a mere creature feature, making it a truly thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating experience.The cinematography in Alien is breathtaking, with Ridley Scott utilizing lighting and shadow to create a sense of unease and mystery. The use of practical effects, such as the chestburster scene, remains groundbreaking and shocking even by today's standards. The combination of stunning visuals, a haunting score, and exceptional editing all come together to create an immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience.It is worth noting that Alien may not be suitable for all viewers due to its intense and graphic nature. The film does not shy away from gore and body horror, which may be unsettling for some. However, for those who can appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship behind the film, Alien is an absolute must-watch.In conclusion, Alien is a true masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its groundbreaking creature design, intense atmosphere, and thought-provoking themes make it a landmark film in the science fiction genre. With its unforgettable performances, stunning visuals, and relentless tension, Alien remains a must-watch classic for any cinephile or sci-fi enthusiast. Strap yourself in and prepare for a thrilling journey into the depths of space and the darkest corners of the human psyche.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535416/?ref_=tt_urv
3,64. The Shining,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0081505,The best horror I've ever seen.,"And that's primarily thanks to the staggering acting of Jack Nicholson, who put in one of the top 10 best lead performances I've ever laid my eyes upon. It's literally the Jack Nicholson show for 2h 26m, and we're all just lucky to be witnessing it. Also, Stanley Kubrick's direction is unbelievably extraordinary. However it's such a pity to hear about his subhuman treatment of Shelley Duvall during filming. It doesn't dock my rating, but it is rather disappointing.Back to positives though, I was thoroughly impressed by Danny Lloyd's performance as Danny Torrance (the child), especially considering he didnt even know he was acting in a horror movie (as the crew had led him to believe they were shooting a drama film instead)! As for Shelley Duvall, I would say that her character wasn't written all that amazingly for this screenplay (which is actually part of the reason why Stephen King doesn't like this picture), but with saying that, I do think she managed to do the best she could, considering both this and the harsh treatment she suffered on set.Finally, despite the fact that this truly is the best horror flick I've watched, I found the ending quite bemusing, so much so that I honestly had to watch an 'Ending Explained' video just to get a grasp on it. Also, I found the climax just before it a little underwhelming, but in saying that, it did make sense to me once I'd understood the meaning behind the final shot. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Kubrick's execution of the closing 5 or 10 minutes was fairly flawed in my opinion.Overall, I was left speechless by this picture. It really is astonishing, and it's understandably a cult classic. 100% a must-watch before you die. 100%.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9520365/?ref_=tt_urv
4,150. The Thing,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0084787,An exercise in how to create a growing sense of paranoia and tension,"In a remote research station in Antarctica in 1982, the members of its team unexpectedly encounter the inhabitants of a neighboring Norwegian research station, who are trying to kill a dog that has escaped from their base. After killing the crazed Norwegians, the shaken research crew flies out to their base only to find all of them are either dead or missing. All they find are the remains of an unknown creature that the Norwegians had attempted to burn. It soon becomes clear to them all that what they have found is an alien life form. However, before long it becomes terrifyingly apparent that the creature can take over and copy other life forms, and that it spreads from one person to another like a virus. Before long paranoia takes hold of the team, whose trust in one another swiftly deteriorates, and terror descends upon them.An adaptation of John W. Campbell Jr., novella Who Goes There? The Thing had been originally loosely adapted into the 1951 science fiction-horror film The Thing from Another World. Several directors would be considered before cult movie director John Carpenter who had gained critical acclaim for his low-budget 1978 horror movie Halloween. Starring Kurt Russell who had only just previously worked with Carpenter on the science fiction action film Escape From New York, the movie features what was at the time a relatively unknown cast of actors. It, like Halloween, has a basic premise, which relies heavily on an ever-pervasive sense of dread, and a sense of cloying paranoia. It probably comes as no coincidence that the movie was released just a few short years after Ridley Scott's 1979 Science-Fiction Horror classic Alien. Indeed, it may be said that Carpenter may have taken some inspirational cues from Scott's masterpiece. Both have remote secluded settings which add a degree of claustrophobic tension into the mix. Quentin Tarantino himself has cited The Thing as having inspired his debut masterpiece Reservoir Dogs, with its themes of paranoia and the use of a small backdrop.Similar to 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers directed by Don Siegel, the movie relies on a growing sense of inevitability and dread, as each of the movie's 12 protagonists succumb to the paranoia that begins to swallow them. Its intense, somber atmosphere is echoed by Ennio Morricones' intense and eerie synth score. As with Halloween, Carpenter knows how to pull his audience's strings so before long they're looking over their shoulder, or looking around every corner long after the movie has ended. He makes excellent use of the minimalistic aspect of the movie's setting, with its closed-in environment adding to the ever-increasing anxiety of his characters. It's to the movie's testament that its amazing, eye-popping practical effects from Rob Bottin still hold up to this very day. When the Thing reveals itself under its human guise, the scenes of it contorting and twisting or detaching itself from the rest of its physiognomy are a true work of art. Carpenter also allows for subtle touches of subtle, dark humor while never undermining the movie's grueling intensity.In the role of R. J. MacReady, Russell is in typically dry and sardonic territory and brings just the right touch of wry bravado to proceedings. Essentially becoming the alpha male of a group of men, who have begun to turn in on themselves. He's given fine support from a cast that includes Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Keith David, and Donald Moffat.Both a commercial and critical flop on its release, and it perhaps wasn't helped that it had to contend with a certain Extra-Terrestrial, it has eventually been evaluated and given more of the kudos it deserves. The Thing is something of a seminal piece of film-making and a solid lesson in evoking atmosphere and a palpable sense of paranoia and dread. It along with Aliens stands as one of the cult iconic Science-Fiction Horror movies of the 80's.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9541058/?ref_=tt_urv
5,172. Godzilla Minus One,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt23289160,This is what a monster film should be,"Compared to the mediocre American Godzilla films, Godzilla Minus One outshines them in every aspect. The character development is some of the best in a monster movie, the audience can actually connect properly to the human characters in a way that nicely drives the film overall and there are never any dialogue scenes that are a slog to get through. The Godzilla destruction and special FX are also top notch, although there are only a handful of action scenes through the film they are masterfully crafted as Godzilla fights the films protagonists and destroys his way through Japan.Definitely one of the best monster films in recent years.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9541110/?ref_=tt_urv
6,226. The Exorcist,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0070047,First time watching in 2023,"It's really hard to review this movie in 2023, at this point I have watched about 3000 horror movies and I'm an absolute genre lover, however there are some really big classics that I've never seen and always spared to watch. Now that the new Exorcist: Believer movie came out, I thought it's the perfect timing for me to see the Exorcist franchise. The original is known to be one of the best horror movies ever made and so my expectations were really high.I have lots of respect for the movie and what the creators made for the genre when they created it back in 1973 but the problem is that most memorable scenes have been either copied or seen by me from clips or other things. So the only new thing left for me was the story in general which was good but didn't completely overwhelm me. The whole shock factor from some of this scenes that made the viewers stomach turn just isn't the same as back in the day, especially if you've seen this much horror. The movie goes for a tense and eerie atmosphere instead of pointless jump scares every few minutes and has some really scary imagery with some deep hitting drama mixed in. All and all I really respect the movie and never wanna criticize its status but seeing it this late sadly took some of the enjoyment.However it's a great movie and should be watched by every genre fan or movie fan in general. [6,3/10]",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9525102/?ref_=tt_urv
