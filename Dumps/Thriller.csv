1,3. The Dark Knight,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0468569,The Real Dark Knight,"I have to say.The BEST movie i've seen.Excellent storyline, and the most important thing is that when you step out of the movie theatre YOU want to be The Dark Knight.Which is basically the main purpose of a comic movie.Basically the only super hero with no superpowers, yet you still want to be Batman, just goes to show how amazing this movie was directed.The whole cast played their parts perfectly, especially Heath Ledger, his performance was truly Oscar worthy.I have watched this movie so many times and it just never gets old.I'm so glad Christopher Nolan decided to direct a Batman movie, or we wouldn't one of the best movies ever directed.Just Phenomenal!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540698/?ref_=tt_urv
2,14. Inception,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1375666,A Smart Summer Blockbuster!,"Christopher Nolan knocked it out of the park with Inception. A movie that is about a dream within a dream within another dream. Basically there are 4 stages to the dream here. Inception shows that a smart movie can still be considered a Summer Blockbuster instead of a mindless action film. The movie features an A list cast with a lot of Nolan familars like Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Michael Caine. Leo is of course the main lead here and he puts on a great performance of someone who is internally conflicted but is also trying to help his team pull off an impossible heist. Those that say this movie is to confusing or don't understand need to pay attention more as Nolan pretty much plays everything out here to follow. Inception is a film that is meant to be experienced and will be considered a classic. Inception gets 10 stars out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9533970/?ref_=tt_urv
3,19. Se7en,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114369,Riveting despite the plot holes,"Fincher's mastery of mise en scene is probably never better than here in Se7en. Like Virgil, Fincher guides us through Hell, but Hell on Earth, designed around a serial killer using the Biblical seven deadly sins as his motive. The scenes of death (always post crime) are meticulously filmed and edited to ensure we are never mere observers but at one with the ongoing investigation and as we spiral down deeper into the abyss the world around us becomes more terrifying, none more so than that of the prostitute killing. Interspersed is a brilliant chase scene during a rainstorm where even the weather seems to be weaponised.Morgan Freeman is simply peerless and doesn't put a foot wrong. Brad Pitt, for me, struggles with his delivery at times, almost overacting to try and make the point but his physicality and screen presence is comparable with Steve McQueen at his finest and brilliantly handles his wordless part in the demoument, the despair of wanting revenge and trying to resist, riddled in his eyes.Spacey appears only briefly, but his character, like Harry Lime in The Third Man, kept in the background, haunts subsequent viewings.My one problem is with the demouement and I'm sure it will be contentious with Se7en fans.The power of what John Doe does is his belief that he is wreaking vengeance on those that deserve it - cue his valedictory in the car en route to the final scene, where he espouses the righteousness of his actions. How, one might ask, does his final killing of Tracy fit that scenario? She is simply a pregnant wife scared for the future of her baby being born into such a cruel world. John Doe, knowing this, despatches an innocent victim in a despicable manner and contrary to the design of his previous murders. We discover that this is designed to provoke Mills, who has shown his penchant for losing his temper, to despatch John Doe and complete the deadly sin cycle of Covetousness (John Doe) and Wrath (Mills) but in doing so this consigns John Doe's actions to that of yet another serial killer and diminishes the power of the original premise.I believe the script acknowledges the problematic, introducing the dialogue from John Doe's telephone converstion with Mills after his apartment is discovered, where John Doe informs the detectives he will have to alter his plans, insinuating that there were different envy/wrath punishments in the offing. What these were we are never told but we presume the ultimate outcome of these would still have been the self-sacrifice of John Doe at the end and with the best will in the world I can't see how he would've achieved that.It's a small criticism of a film that, more than many at the end of the nineties, encapsultes the violence of the 20th century and prophesizes the fears of the 21st.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537204/?ref_=tt_urv
4,23. The Silence of the Lambs,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0102926,I need to watch this again,"I finished watching this movie and have spent over an hour trying to answer my lingering questions. This led me through a bunch of YouTube videos that broke down just how complex and layered this movie is with hidden messages that make it so incredible. I also ended up going through Reddit posts and finally got all the answers to my questions but not until I learned info from the book that's not in the movie. Without it, I'm not sure how the audience is expected to piece everything together. So this is absolutely a movie that I want to and need to watch again. On a second watch, I think there's a good chance I will love it so much more than I already do. But for now, I can only give it an 8 because I did have so many lingering questions after it. Moving on from that, what an incredible movie. The scene where we first see Lecter is one of the creepiest feelings I've ever had. The storytelling, especially from Clarice's perspective is incredibly and the relationship that unfolds between the two of them is fascinating. Also, my jaw was literally on the floor when I saw how Lecter escapes using the ambulance. So a really incredible movie, but one I need to watch again to be able to fully understand and appreciate even more.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540463/?ref_=tt_urv

The film's dark humor adds a layer of complexity, making it both entertaining and intellectually stimulating. The meticulously designed sets and cinematography enhance the storytelling, creating a palpable atmosphere.

No but seriously, dude has a serious problem with sexualisation of children.""Oh but that's part of the story! She's falling love with Léon!!1!""
That's not what I mean. I mean the very specific cinematographic choices.No wonder this was cut to bits for releases in other countries.Portman is overrated, btw. Sure, an accomplishment for a child. But the way this performance is praised? Ridiculous. Reno is solid. Nicely nuanced. Oldman is the absolute MVP. Unhinged in best of ways. There is crazy overacted cringe to stand out. And then there's Oldman. Definitely one of his best ever.The music is OBNOXIOUS.If you fail to develop emotional depth as a director. Slapping overly dramatic and LOUD music on 90% of the runtime doesn't make up for it.The plot holes are ridiculous.The police ""protocols"" are so incredibly over the top, makes it look like a satire while taking itself too serious in other scenes.While some dialogue gems are to be found. The majority, especially in the first half, is an outright crime to the art of writing.No child, ever, on planet Earth or elsewhere, would talk like Mathilda does under any circumstance ever. Not that it's too mature. That's plausible I suppose. It's just written as if a badly developed AI did the job. But what can you expect from this director.Fortunately, it picks up quality in the last act.But holymoly, the objectification of children and teens (not only Mathilda) goes CRAZY in this one. Hard to watch, unless you're rightfully on another type of watchlist.Solid, though also ridiculous, action.Looks like NYC in the 70s instead of the 90s.Why, btw?Did I miss something? But that doesn't distract that much.Give this idea to a better director and writer and you might actually have a 8,5/10 movie as how it currently (01/24) stands on IMDB.4/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535869/?ref_=tt_urv
8,40. The Departed,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0407887,I love it!,"The Departed is a movie that combines impulsive and precise collage assembly, which is so energetic that it even infiltrates the post-production. The movie utilizes constant parallel editing and sudden music cues that repeat and cut out of nowhere, which makes it feel radical even after several years since it was released. The movie's construction is truly wild, and it is hard to describe it with words. The film has no rhythm, just a love for abrupt recycling. Jack Nicholson walks out of the shadows four different times in the first ten minutes, and his character's performance is crude. However, that kind of messy and blunt performance is able to exist in a carefully calibrated film such as this.The movie juggles one scene with five other scenes and fifty cutaways, but it all moves forward in a logical way. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is so isolated and tormented, and his life is overtly juxtaposed against Matt Damon's character's life. This enhances DiCaprio's character's predicament, making us feel even more for him and loathe Damon even more. Thelma Schoonmaker did a great job of assembling the movie in such a way that it is intricate and freewheeling.The movie has a lot of energy and piecemeal bits to burn, which makes it seem like the film took on a life of its own and got away from the filmmakers at the finish line. The final shot, which is terribly ham-fisted, illustrates this weird energy that The Departed has. However, it adds to the movie's charm, making it unique and fun to watch.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535654/?ref_=tt_urv
9,42. The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0482571,The ending falls flat,"This movie is a fantastic presentation of sacrifice in rivalries and losing everything over an obsession, the question of 'How?' leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout, and while that curiosity was answered, it led into a strange sci-fi turn that I think destroys the whole premise of magicians being an 'illusion' and, as shown throughout the movie, people knowing that its a con, but wanting to believe as a source of wonder and amazement. The twist and revelation of Christian Bale's character was unexpected and teased unknowingly throughout the film and while the 'twin' reveal may be a little cliche I think it was done amazingly and really showed how something so simple can torment. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman's twist was, as I mentioned earlier, drifting into the supernatural and, funnily enough, I had a prediction that was almost exact to the twist but thought it unbelievable and a poor plot so it was discarded.Overall, 'The Prestige' is definitely worth watching but It does leave you feeling a little unsatisfied afterwards.The acting is amazing - as is the cast, and living the suspense with both characters instead of dramatic irony is really quite unique and exhilarating.7.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530923/?ref_=tt_urv
10,45. The Usual Suspects,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114814,The masterclass in storytelling-an intricately woven crime thriller,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a masterclass in storytelling-an intricately woven crime thriller that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats until its breathtaking conclusion. Directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie, this film is a gripping exploration of deception, manipulation, and the elusive nature of truth.The narrative centers around a police interrogation of the sole survivor of a massacre and a heist gone wrong, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). As Kint recounts the events leading up to the tragedy, a web of intrigue unfolds, involving a group of criminals with shadowy connections to the enigmatic crime lord Keyser Söze.What sets ""The Usual Suspects"" apart is its non-linear storytelling and unreliable narrator, which keeps viewers guessing until the final revelatory moments. McQuarrie's sharp script and Singer's deft direction create an atmosphere of tension and suspense, crafting a narrative puzzle that challenges audiences to piece together the truth.The film is propelled by a stellar ensemble cast, with standout performances from Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, and Kevin Pollak. Spacey's portrayal of Verbal Kint is particularly memorable, exuding a cunning charm that keeps the audience second-guessing his motives until the shocking climax.""The Usual Suspects"" is renowned for its twist ending-one that subverts expectations and reshapes the entire narrative. This unexpected conclusion, coupled with the film's intricate plot and character dynamics, invites multiple viewings to uncover the layers of deception woven into the story.The film's legacy as a gripping and cleverly crafted crime thriller endures, earning its place as a cult classic in the genre. Its impact lies in its ability to keep audiences engaged, questioning the nature of truth and the depths of deception, long after the credits roll.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534475/?ref_=tt_urv

A biography of Cornell Woolrich could merit the same title and ""Rear Window"" is the perfect marriage of two purely unique and supremely talented artists. Hitchcock's pictorial compositions, staging and editing were never better than here, where most of the action is confined to the room where the hero is recuperating from an accident. James Stewart talent for conveying anxiety and nervousness underscores the suspense as his lovely fiancee, Grace Kelly, attempts to help him solve a murder perpetrated by a demented neighbor, Raymond Burr. The Hitchcock/Woolrich theme of perverse evil in the midst of amiable normalcy has never been more vividly and elegantly illustrated.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9519129/?ref_=tt_urv

Bravo for that, even if it's annoying to the viewer.The problem is that the film is completely one of those pretentious 'ambiguous' believe what you want to movies. You watch in this annoying format hoping to get concrete answers, but never do. The ending, or beginning, depending on how you see it, is completely up to you to figure out.

It makes you think how it's different now since there is a lot more technology and mediums involved with this kind of spying even in so called ""democracies"" and ""free"" societies, and the acting on top of all of that was good as well. It kind of slowed down in the middle of the film a bit but by the end it wrapped itself up very nicely and it was good closure with how the story and arcs were handled.

14,65. Witness for the Prosecution,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0051201,Clever and remarkably entertaining courtroom drama,"This clever and remarkably entertaining courtroom drama is quite possible the best big-screen adaptation of any Agatha Christie story. The film stars an obesely overweight and delightfully arrogant Charles Laughton as an expert defence barrister who takes on a seemingly impossible case of defending a good-natured American man (Tyrone Power) in a murder case full of circumstantial evidence - including the statement of his wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), which may or may not implicate him. Fans of crackerjack writing will be treated to plenty of intellectual banter and delightful twists, right up until the very end. Crisp black-and-white cinematography by Russell Harlan and skilful narrative pacing courtesy of veteran director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard) make the movie a feast for eyes and mind despite a very limited number of locations. Laughton is superb as the lethargic and acerbic but very much principled Sir Wilfrid. This was Tyrone Power's last fully completed film before his sudden death in Madrid a year after its release.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9508284/?ref_=tt_urv
15,67. Alien 2,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0090605,A Spectacular Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is a sensational continuation of Ridley Scott's Alien, taking the franchise to new heights and solidifying itself as an extraordinary science fiction masterpiece. This action-packed and suspenseful film not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every aspect, delivering an unforgettable cinematic experience.Set several decades after the events of the first film, Aliens immerses us in a future where humans have colonized other planets.

Oldeuboi,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0364569,worth watching and thinking,"Frankly speaking, it's a great film, even though the storyline seems absurd, shocking, and against the common social morality. Never gossip others' personal life as long as it wouldn't interfere with our own interests. People should learn to respect and tolerate with each other's social behavior as long as it wouldn't physically hurt anyone and do real harm to the stability of our society. At the very least, if you don't agree with other people's ""bizarre"" but non-harmful behavior, you can simply choose not to socialize with them and let them be. People should never ever publicly expose others' privacy, let alone insulting those who are different from us. Anyway, I think we all can learn a thing or two from this movie, even though most of us might feel extremely uncomfortable with these shocking scenes.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540509/?ref_=tt_urv
18,80. Joker,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt7286456,Society is terrible,"This is probably one of the most successful examples of a gorgeous solo film about some popular character.The Joker was played by the inimitable Joaquin Phoenix (known for his role in Gladiator), and people comparing him to Ledger are very narrow-minded, because Phoenix showed us a completely new Joker, who is gorgeous in his own way.The plot tells about a sick man Arthur, who suffers eternal ridicule over himself, lives and cares for his mother, and also dreams of being accepted by people, thanks to his performance on Murray's favorite humor show (De Niro)
As a result, we will see a man becoming a monster because of our society, of course not without his mental illness, but the nature of people clearly pushed the main character to become a Joker.This is a gorgeous dramatic thriller, with some cool reference for the future (little Bruce, Thomas Wayne, etc.), which is a must-watch!

THRILLER/ DRAMAAdapted from the novel by Edo Makubein associate produced, co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, directing a ""Ransom-like"" scenario where the father's son gets kidnapped, this adds a whole new spin to that kind of genre where it's not the father's son that gets captured but the chauffeur's son. And there's a little cat and mouse where it's always fascinating how the police work together to capture this perpetrator. The only problem with the overall film is that the film feels a little out dated but does an extremely good job about debating it's complicated situations regarding the ransom.

20,90. Idi I Smotri,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0091251,A stunning and eerie cinematic experience.,"The film's strength is its ability to portray the emotional and psychological toll that war has on its protagonists. The breakdown of innocence and the severe psychological effects of violence are expertly captured by Klimov. An immersive experience that makes the audience feel the weight of the characters' experiences is created by the use of long takes and dramatic, almost documentary-like cinematography. These are excellent performances, especially Kravchenko's. Florya's development from an innocent and idealistic youngster to a shell-shocked observer of unspeakable horrors is portrayed by the young actor with compelling effect. The vast variety of characters impacted by the war is portrayed by the supporting cast, which further enhances the film's authenticity. The film's sound design is also noteworthy; Oleg Yanchenko's eerie and moving score nicely contrasts with the austere images. The film's immersive atmosphere is enhanced, and each scene's emotional effect is amplified by the sounds of battle, ranging from distant explosions to the frightening cries of troops. It is difficult to watch Come and See (a warning) because it shows the severity of war without sugarcoating or romanticizing its atrocities. A realistic depiction of the catastrophic impact of conflict on both persons and communities is produced by Klimov's directing decisions and the film's relentless narrative. The brilliantly made and very moving movie serves as a sobering reminder of the human cost of war. Some viewers may find its uncompromising style difficult to handle, but for those prepared to face the brutal facts of history, this film offers a profoundly moving and provocative cinematic experience.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9506523/?ref_=tt_urv
