1,30. Spider-man: Across the Spider-verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt9362722,A Visually Stunning and Compelling Sequel,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film! First off, it is visually stunning, and it's evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into its creation. The visuals alone tell a compelling story of characters' emotions and set the tone for each scene. The cast, much like in the previous film, delivers outstanding performances, with Hailee Steinfeld particularly standing out in this one. The character progression of Miles from the first movie is a highlight, especially as the film places him at a crossroads. The soundtrack is among the best in recent memory, leaving a lasting impact even after the credits roll. The exploration of family themes is well-executed, although the second half slightly dips in this regard for the reviewer. The only downside I have is that much of the film's advertisement centered around the second half, which created a sense of having seen a huge portion of it already. The film also ends somewhat abruptly, but this is expected from the first part of a series. Overall, it stands as one of the best comic films to date in my opinion, and I think anyone could give it a watch, whether or not they enjoy superhero content.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540660/?ref_=tt_urv
2,32. Spirited Away,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0245429,A beautiful story with lovable characters,"I would argue that Spirited Away is my favourite Studio Ghibli film. A friend of mine introduced me to Ghibli through this movie when I was a kid and I cannot give higher praise.We follow the main character, Chihiro, a seemingly immature and needy child who finds herself in the world of kami. The plot revolves around her finding a way to free herself and her parents from this world and the witch Yubaba. The beauty of this protagonist is how much she changes from her experience in kami and the lessons she learns from the characters she meets along the way.Each character we meet has separate personalities and goals, and they each help Chihiro in one way or another, whether that is actively helping her and being a friend, or being an adversary. All of the characters are grey, with no real black or white, making characters more realistic and applicable to real life.The visual experience alone is gorgeous, the animation is flawless and captivating. The music is relaxing and captures the essence of the story.This film is excellent and I seriously suggest watching it in the original Japanese with subtitles. This is one Ghibli film that is much better in Japanese than the English dub.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539507/?ref_=tt_urv
3,37. The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0110357,Superb,"I saw The Lion King when it was released in the cinema 30 years ago, yes that long ago! Funnily enough, right now I'm watching for the first time the Twilight Zone Lost Classics which was also released the same year as The Lion King, and believe it or not, the host of the Lost Classics is James Earl Jones, who also voiced
Mufasa in The Lion King. So James Earl Jones was quite busy in 1994.Anyway, I don't think The Lion King is for young kids as some scenes are quite scary and all. Anyway, I haven't seen the sequels, and I haven't seen the stage play but maybe I should because it's worthwhile.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540268/?ref_=tt_urv
4,43. Grave of the Fireflies,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0095327,Beautiful fireflies,"What an amazing movie!!!!It was so beautiful and so emotional. I could not stop myself crying. Watched many animation movie, only few of them will give you this kind of emotions. I will remember this movie for many years for sure.First I hesitate to watch this movie because it's an old movie, I thought the animation won't be good. But I want try it Because of the hype. I'm glad I tried this and it deserves the hype.And everything so good In whole movie. I don't think I can move From this movie, It will haunt me for a week.. now I need to watch another light hearted movie to overcome this emotion.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9495604/?ref_=tt_urv
5,58. WALLÂ·E,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0910970,One of the bravest and most unique Pixar films,"Pixar has, indeed, a very impressive track record of providing very imaginative, revolutionary animated films, many of them considered not just incredible animated films, but some of the best films of all time, even receiving Best Picture Oscar nominations.This is indeed one of their most unique films, being a very isolated film consisting mainly of voicless robot characters, and in a very unique, immensely beautiful style. It is a great, deep and profound story about the future of humanity in ever interesting ways, that is conveyed to exception.Overall, definitely one of the best animated films, and movies overall. And very much desreving of its spot on IMDb's Top 250 list!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530148/?ref_=tt_urv
6,63. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt4633694,Decent but not amazing,Ok so I finally decided to watch the immensely popular spiderman animated films and while I like an occasional superhero film I don't adore them. Seeing how popular these films are and since I had watched the marvel spiderman films too I thought I should watch the animated films. I had high expectations for this seeing how well received it had been and I actually enjoyed it. The animation is refreshing and original and the story is interesting but overall I find it pretty average. It's a decent film but it's not amazing. I would recommend it though it isn't bad but just overhyped in my opinion.,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9528030/?ref_=tt_urv
7,74. Coco,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2380307,Good retraction,"The history tells about a little boy called Miguel, and his adventure. Since early already is shown to the public how his family hates music, and also tells about the history of his grandpa and how asshole he was (as far as it had been shown). Beyond the whole history delevoped in the movie, also is shown indirectly the culture of Mexico and how the people lead with the death, what is in my opinion really beatifull. The art of this movie is fantastic, and the work well done with the soudtrack is unbelievable. I'm even now with the songs in my head, ""Remember me"", for example, depicts perfectly the relation of the protagonist with his grandma and what he feels about her.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9490136/?ref_=tt_urv
8,76. Toy Story,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114709,I love it.,"Brilliant story of friendship and imagination. I give this film high praise for the casting, performances and animation. Tom Hanks in particular is brilliant in this, I simply loved his voice acting for Woody. The film generated a huge amount of excitement and comment at the time due to it's amazing animation but for me it's the story which comes first. The music in the film is great and fits very well whatever see going on in the different scenes. The whole idea of the toys having to keep their lives a secret from the humans was very clever too. The film is just a brilliant tale of jealousy, lost identity and friendship, huge themes for a kids film but it's all pulled off with such skill. A brilliant movie.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523311/?ref_=tt_urv
9,81. Mononoke-hime,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0119698,My favourite film of all time,"When I was young, this film was more of a beautiful spectacle of animation rather than a interesting plot. The art to this film is beyond any doubt one of the best in animation history. This alone could make me rate this a 10/10 film, many could argue movies like your name or suzume could surpass the art. Hayoa miyazi prides himself in hand drawn animation, as seen in most of his films, and this to me brings this movie up a lot.Beauty of art aside, the plot to this film is insane. Though the only negative I would have is how slow the beginning is, putting a lot of people off. A plot where the character is neither in the ""good"" or ""bad"" and rather helps everyone and is then seen of a bad guy from both sides. The good and bad side is completely the choice of the viewer (though most would be on princess mononokes side).The antagonist to this film is arguably the most ambiguous character in the film. Is she really evil for the pain she has put on the land, or is she a good person for the service and valour she has given to her own kind?Hayao miyazi also produces well thought out, powerful female characters with faults and development that many films these days lack.There is so much to unpack in this film its ridiculous.I would generally call this film one of the best. And I recommend it 100%",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538920/?ref_=tt_urv

11,91. Toy Story 3,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0435761,So funny and smartly written,"The best toy story film in my view. The new story feels fresh and energetic, full of old and new characters. The animation of the humans has improved remarkably too since the original. The film is full of fun, action and some genuinely touching moments that leave a lump in the front. Though it has lots of entertainment for children this is a film that adults can really appreciate too. The film had me and the rest of my family in stiches at times. The Ken and Barbie storyline in particular was utterly brilliant. I really wish the storyline had ended here because it was the perfect point to end on.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523227/?ref_=tt_urv
12,111. Up,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1049413,"A beautiful, creative and wonderfully written story.","This movie is perfect in so many ways. First of all, it made me cry within the first 10 minutes which I think is an almost impossible feat by a simple movie. It shows me a beautiful bond by two people and then proceeds to reference it constantly throughout the movie reminding me of the past (a good thing) this movie has incredible storytelling and a clever twist. It is a very wild plot, but we are settled into it so amazingly. Soon enough we are watching several hundred dogs chase a man with a floating house, a Boy Scout, a talking dog and a mysterious random bird. And the leader of these dogs is a man gone rogue/crazy who was once the idol of Carl and Ellie. I find that Russell confides in Carl because he never had a proper father figure. And Carl loves Russell deeply because he never got to have children of his own. The villain is one of the most creative I've ever seen. He was an idol. They bonded over him and fell in love. But when they finally meet him he is a crazy mean guy who kills for fortune. This movie makes me cry for sadness and happiness. Carl goes crazy trying to complete the one goal him and Ellie had. But he has to learn to move on and that love is in the moment. We can look on the last but we must love who we have now and where we are. I think one of the most important moments in this movie is when Carl sits down in his newly placed home, completely alone, and he reflects on ""The adventure book"" that Ellie made. Further proof that he only thinks about what he wants and how to replicate what he had. But he never looked past the ""things I'm going to do"" part. Because it had pictures of him and Ellie all through it. And at the end it has a note form Ellie. ""Thanks for the adventure - now go have a new one!"" This made me ball my eyes out. This could not be more of a sign that the real Ellie wouldn't want him to pursue their goals, but would want him to continue on with his life and have new adventures. Beautiful. And the book changed him so much that he threw out a bunch of chairs and photos and memorabilia from his and Ellie's life. Showing us that he had moved on. INCREDIBLE. And then the cherry on top, his house floats away and it symbolises him moving on from Ellie. THEN CARL GOES TO HIS CEREMONY AND GIVES HIM ELLIES GRAPE SODA PIN I CANT. This is a brilliant movie and like it or not, it's better than onward. MADE ME CRY SO HARD. (I wrote this in my diary and I decided the world of IMDB needed to hear it.)",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9503711/?ref_=tt_urv
13,154. Finding Nemo,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0266543,A Children's Movie That's Still Very Good,"I think it's great to revisit the animations we watched as kids. To be able to experience the nostalgic feeling of that moment and to be able to experience the movie again in a smarter way probably means that we will have a very good 2 hours. Especially if the movie is really good, as opposed to just being good for us because we're kids.I think this movie is a very good example of that. It is debatable how much this movie is aimed at children. I personally didn't see it as a children's movie, I don't think any adult watching this movie is going to talk about how childish this movie is. I can understand this better when I watch the movie at my age. Even though some elements of the movie may seem simple to us as children, it actually contains really interesting events and characters. At the very beginning of the movie we are confronted with a father who has lost his wife and all but one of his children. So much so that this father can only save one of his hundreds of children (although this seems to devalue them, it makes the only child left behind very valuable) and that child is born physically disabled. Nemo, a character who is not good enough at swimming, appears this time. Although he can't fully swim because one of his fins is too small, Nemo is actually a good swimmer despite his disability. Of course, this father is very afraid that something will happen to his only child Nemo because of what he has been through and naturally he becomes a very restrictive father. This eventually leads Nemo to dislike his father. We have the blue fish, who is his father's traveling companion after the separation, and the fish in the aquarium where Nemo gets caught and falls in. The fish in this aquarium are certainly very interesting and entertaining, especially the leader. In the same way, what happens to the father in the ocean when he's looking for his son is definitely a very interesting story. Even the interestingness of these stories is handled and processed. Thanks to the writer of this script. He really did a very good job. My expectations were not very high, but I think that a cautionary tale was written. Who would have thought of intellectual vegan sharks?As usual, I can't talk about the quality of the animation because I don't know enough about it nor have I seen enough to comment on it, but nothing bothered me. The fish were also very cute. The effects were good too. Unfortunately, I don't have much to say about it. Even though the soundtrack wasn't ""How to Train Your Dragon"", it wasn't bad and I won't dislike it. In fact, I still remember a few specific ones.The dubbing of animated movies in Turkey is definitely very good. Of course, I can't make a comparison without watching the original, so I won't make a comparison. The Turkish dub is very entertaining. It seems that we are a very advanced country in animation dubbing. Especially the Dori voice actor really acted like a character.So this movie is not a movie that we like only because we watched it when we were little. It's still a rocking movie. I think it's a very entertaining movie that handles the concepts I like very much, does not drag itself out, and does not slow down its pace. I think I can recommend it to everyone from 7 to 70.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9515932/?ref_=tt_urv
14,158. Hauru No Ugoku Shiro,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0347149,"Really good movie, just one complaint","Sometimes, the more ""comic"" characters would be present in dramatic or emotional scenes, so I wasn't fully immersed in them as I kept expecting one of those characters to speak up and make a joke at the wrong time. It is a shame too, since Studio Ghibli films usually have pretty good emotional scenes. Well, apart from the ridiculously copious amount of tears that characters shed whenever they cry, of course. But otherwise, I really liked the animation (as par for the course with Studio Ghibli films), the backgrounds, and the structuring of the scenes centring around the war attacks. I do wish that aspect of the movie could have been a bit more elaborated on, and the ending felt a bit too idyllic, but oh well.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9513244/?ref_=tt_urv
15,167. Inside Out,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2096673,The last great Pixar movie,"Confession time: I didn't like Coco very much.Inside Out was the last Pixar film I truly loved, the last which still feel having the same creative spark which inspired family classics such as Ratatouille and Up. (Coincidentally, this was co-directed by Pete Docter, who previously worked in the aftermentioned movie along with Bob Peterson)In the same vein of the best Pixar movies, clever humor is perfectly well combined with genuine heartfelt moments, sincere and relatable for any casual viewer.Modern Pixar has lost that earnest quality, in my opinion. Some of their movies are still entertaining, and have many positive qualities, but something feels different about them nowadays. Almost as if something was missing.Hope the announced sequel have at least a half of the charm the first movie had. Still, is a bit sad to see modern Pixar so focused in sequels.8.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530951/?ref_=tt_urv

Mostly the 90s and early 2000s classics. I remember watching this movie back when it was first released, and felt in love with it instantly. I decided to Re-watch it, 4 yrs later and I still cried. What a lovely, charming and clever film. A lovely origin story of the wonder of klaus. I can already see myself rewatching it in the future and still crying. Esp, when the little sami girl finally got her gift. The quote, ""A true selfless act always sparks another"" will stick with me.

17,178. My Neighbour Totoro,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0096283,A Pure Comfort Film,"This movie is warm and magical. Studio Ghibli usually thrives in the outlandish and strange, and this movie only dabbles in both. The story is simple, the characters are relatable and the animation is beautiful (as always).The relationship between the sisters (and their parents) is at the center of the story, which I love. That being said, I wanted more adventures with the titular character. I was hoping for a little more closure in the end, but it is still a fantastic movie. It's a pure comfort film to watch on a rainy day.Best Character: Totoro
Best Scene: Flying
Best Piece of Score: ""The Path of the Wind""",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9525701/?ref_=tt_urv
18,"203. Monsters, Inc.",https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0198781,"Monsters, Inc.","Talk about renewable energy! An entire city can be powered by the racket make by children when they scream... To that end an whole industry exists providing scary monsters to get the youngsters to bellow. A security breach sees their factory overrun by toddlers and boss ""Waternoose"" is terrified it will ruin the business. They all have to be rounded up by the pest controllers and returned home. Well, of course one ""Boo"" manages to avoid capture and she is soon befriended by the big wooly ""Sully"". His roar is terrifying, but his bark is certainly worse than his bite and together with his green cyclops pal ""Mike"" they have loads of fun adventures trying to keep the child safe from the hands of the nasty ""Randall"" and get her back to her own bed! This is a very simple story and it works really well. The animation is enjoyable to watch, the writing is quickly-paced and quite wittily observational at times and the characters - especially ""Sully"", are creatively personified and engaging. Luckily, the yelling brats are kept to a minimum and what we end up with is a sort of, well, love story. It has all the usual Pixar/Disney messages of loyalty and teamwork - only this is depicted with much more playfulness and we've even got a yeti with a never-ending supply of snow-cones!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9478698/?ref_=tt_urv
19,206. How to Train Your Dragon,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0892769,I have seen the same movie hundreds of times,"The main problem with this movie is that once it starts you already know the rest of the film. It just follows the same formula of an unlikely idiot hero with a secret and once he made some good progress thanks to his secret.... booom! Everything is exposed, there is sadness and dissapointment but then the idiot hero rise and come back stronger to save the day.Unfortunately, there is so many movies with this structure and there is nothing innovative here.On the bright side, you can find good things in this movie, like the relationship between humans and dragons, the animation and even the score, but at the end of the day if you ask me about this movie the answer is: ....... meh.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537839/?ref_=tt_urv
20,207. Mary and Max,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0978762,A Cinematic Masterpiece That Touches the Heart and Provokes Thought,"When an old boulder like me is moved by something, it means something. ""Mary & Max"" is so delicately heartfelt that you almost don't realize how emotionally overwhelmed you become - until you find yourself sitting there at the end with a tear inevitably streaming down your cheek.In recent years, I can guarantee that I have rarely seen a film with such a brilliantly written story. It is rich in detail, unique, without being overly sentimental or fluffy in its naivety, but rather embedded in a world that is not very funny.Intelligent, lovable, touching, thought-provoking, with moments that make you smile, and above all, fantastically well thought out. Without a doubt, this is truly great cinema.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539665/?ref_=tt_urv
