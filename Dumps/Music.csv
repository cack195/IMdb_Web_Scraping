1,33. The Pianist,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0253474,Haunting WWII film.,"Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522421/?ref_=tt_urv
2,41. Whiplash,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2582802,The most intense thriller that's not technically a thriller.,"I wanted to kick back and relax tonight by watching three Damien Chazelle films back to back, because in my mind, they form a loose trilogy: Whiplash, La La Land, and Babylon. They all deal with the pursuit of making great art or achieving greatness, and how that clashes with various other things most people place importance on, to summarise the three as broadly as possible.I somehow forgot how stressful the first of these movies was, making it a difficult film to relax to. Even watching Whiplash for what I think is my fourth time does nothing to make it less stressful. Even Uncut Gems, which I've seen a few times now, has gotten a bit less intense with every rewatch. But Whiplash still makes me feel borderline light-headed for much of its runtime, and for that I really respect it. I also love how I still don't know entirely what I think of that excellent ending. The core conflict of the film is one I still think about often, and Whiplash not coming down hard one way or the other is the smartest things it does, at least thematically.Chazelle's later films are visually stronger and bolder, but Whiplash is just so wonderfully tight and free of even a second of filler. It's still a good-looking movie, but I feel like most of its visual flair comes from the editing, which is phenomenal, and heightens the intensity of the music, performances, and writing immensely. If Whiplash isn't a perfect movie, then it's so close it might well be. I love it immensely, even though it makes me nauseous.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9541017/?ref_=tt_urv
3,74. Coco,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2380307,Good retraction,"The history tells about a little boy called Miguel, and his adventure. Since early already is shown to the public how his family hates music, and also tells about the history of his grandpa and how asshole he was (as far as it had been shown). Beyond the whole history delevoped in the movie, also is shown indirectly the culture of Mexico and how the people lead with the death, what is in my opinion really beatifull. The art of this movie is fantastic, and the work well done with the soudtrack is unbelievable. I'm even now with the songs in my head, ""Remember me"", for example, depicts perfectly the relation of the protagonist with his grandma and what he feels about her.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9490136/?ref_=tt_urv
4,75. Amadeus,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0086879,characters act to the music love it.,"I like this movie even if I didn't like how the wife performance filled a bit flat most of the time and I had to remember that this was based on a conspiracy theory and it's not real history even if it has a lot of real history in it.Interpreting I didn't really know who to root for but slowly I realized that villain composer was really entertaining and enjoyed every morni. He has of his speechos spiteful relationship with Mozart it is just so fun to ride him torture this guy who totally does not deserve it.And that portrayal of Mozart was really good. In the beginning I hated him I wanted him to suffer because he was such an insufferable break, but I begin to get sympathy for him and he was really sad when he slowly got tortured .What I enjoyed most about the performances was how over the top they could be like. Seeing the most angry Frau on a person and Mozart making the most hilarious laughs. It just went to 10 most of the time which were amazing for this time period because it feels like it was a play for how what's the top everything was.The way the characters act to the music love it. They want every minute of it. I could feel it and I enjoyed classic. I never like before because of their reaction to it.Please watch it even if it is 3 hours Long.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523660/?ref_=tt_urv
5,129. Some Like It Hot,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0053291,"Well, nobody's perfect! Perhaps Some Like It Hot is!?","Billy Wilders 1959 comedy ""Some Like it Hot"" will forever be an absolute masterpiece of comedic cinema. A wonderful cast starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and an astonishing Marilyn Monroe combined with Billy Wilders directing make this film a classic that will never be forgotten.The plot of two male musicians dressing up as women to escape the mob during the prohibition era in Chicago is in itself not only unique but also hilarious.However, as great as this film is in delivering laughs and entertainment, that is not all to it.Some Like It Hot shows how different people were treated by their gender and attractiveness. ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" (the two musicians female alter egos) are constantly being approached or even touched by men throughout the film.All in all, Billy Wilders classic is a great piece of comedic cinema, while it also makes one think about the differences between men and women in society.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9495136/?ref_=tt_urv
6,134.
