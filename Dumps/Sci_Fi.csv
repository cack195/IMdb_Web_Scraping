1,14. Inception,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1375666,A Smart Summer Blockbuster!,"Christopher Nolan knocked it out of the park with Inception. A movie that is about a dream within a dream within another dream. Basically there are 4 stages to the dream here. Inception shows that a smart movie can still be considered a Summer Blockbuster instead of a mindless action film. The movie features an A list cast with a lot of Nolan familars like Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Michael Caine. Leo is of course the main lead here and he puts on a great performance of someone who is internally conflicted but is also trying to help his team pull off an impossible heist. Those that say this movie is to confusing or don't understand need to pay attention more as Nolan pretty much plays everything out here to follow. Inception is a film that is meant to be experienced and will be considered a classic. Inception gets 10 stars out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9533970/?ref_=tt_urv
2,15. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0080684,The best Star Wars film of all time,"The Empire Strikes Back is arguably more Space Opera than science fiction, but whatever it is, it's damned fine entertainment and highly re-watchable. The physical and meta-physical training of farm-boy Luke is an important part of this film, and Yoda amazes -- the only Muppet ever to seem like an organic being and not a puppet.""Do. Or do not. There is no try.""SO many things could have gone wrong with this ambitious project, and none of them did. Like the best Star Wars films, the final shot is moving and has great music (the entire soundtrack is excellent).10/10 -- I don't give out this rating lightly (esp. For a sequel).",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536391/?ref_=tt_urv

The Matrix,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0133093,The groundbreaking piece of cinematic innovation,"""The Matrix"" isn't just a film; it's a groundbreaking piece of cinematic innovation that redefined action movies and challenged the very perception of reality. Directed by the Wachowskis, this sci-fi masterpiece combines mind-bending concepts, stunning visual effects, and philosophical depth to create a cinematic experience that continues to captivate audiences.The story follows Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who goes by the alias Neo (Keanu Reeves), as he discovers that the world he knows is a simulated reality-a computer-generated dream created by sentient machines that have enslaved humanity. Neo joins a rebellion led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to free humanity from the Matrix and uncover his true destiny as ""The One.""""The Matrix"" captivated audiences with its groundbreaking visual effects, including the iconic ""bullet time"" sequences, which redefined action cinematography and set a new standard for visual storytelling. The film's innovative use of CGI and martial arts choreography created a visually stunning and immersive experience.Beyond its technical achievements, ""The Matrix"" is rich in philosophical and existential themes. It delves into questions of reality, free will, and the nature of control, inviting audiences to contemplate the boundaries between perception and truth.The performances, particularly Reeves as the reluctant hero Neo and Fishburne's enigmatic Morpheus, anchor the film's narrative with gravitas and conviction. The chemistry among the cast members and their dedication to their roles contribute to the film's enduring impact.The film's cultural influence extends far beyond the silver screen, permeating into popular culture and inspiring discussions on technology, consciousness, and the nature of existence.

Interstellar,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0816692,Mind-bending,"I am a Christopher Nolan fan by heart, though at the time of watching this film, I had only known of his work with respect to the 'Dark Knight' franchise. But after years of everyone around me telling me that 'Interstellar' is Nolan's masterpiece, I finally gave in. I will admit that the film does not leap out of the gates with intriguing premises, but it is instead a slow-rolling boulder of film that by the end has your jaw hanging as you attempt to wrap your mind around these concepts. I still could not tell you exactly what happens, but this film transcends scientific understanding and instead lets the decisions characters make speak for themselves. A true Nolan twist.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540036/?ref_=tt_urv
5,28. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0076759,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a flawed masterpiece, an adventure you won't forget that pushed the boundaries of special effects - My Ultimate Review","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a sci-fi masterpiece, although it has some flaws it's just easy to look past. This is a Star Wars film I've seen more times than I can count and now it's my second time seeing it on 4K Blu-ray, honestly, each frame looks stunning and is full of detail. This is one of those 4k remasters which is simply perfect with Dolby Vision and HDR which enhances the experience and picture quality immensely. The Dolby Atmos track is too perfect, making it easy to understand why the film won an award for best sound and music. George Lucas directed and wrote the film, also creating ILM for the extensive special effects work on the film. It's a flawed masterpiece as with this film, you see the flaws that George clearly has, but how he went through with his vision and stuck with it. We got one of the best sci-fi films and possibly the best sci-fi franchise thanks to him, a storyteller and visionary. Star Wars was a surprise hit, surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time.Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a Wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle station, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the mysterious Darth Vader.There's a ton of likable characters in this trilogy (Episode IV-VI) and this was the start. We have an inexperienced Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker, what's interesting is how you see his acting improve throughout the film. Then we have Harrison Ford as the charismatic Han Solo who gets all the funny lines which are made funny because of his delivery. His performance is one of the highlights, I could say the same about Hamill and Fisher's who got a career after this film. We have Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa, Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca. On the villain side we have; Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, David Prowse as Darth Vader with James Earl Jones doing the voice for the character, a voice a bit unknown back in the day, but a voice that became iconic. The characters are excellent and the acting can be all from good to average and even below average at times, but that's completely alright with a film with this much heart. I can't help to smile, laugh, and be entertained every single time I watch this film.It's known to the public how George Lucas was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's films, for example The Hidden Fortress with Toshiro Mifune being Lucas' number one pick for Obi-Wan Kenobi but it wasn't meant to be instead we got Alec Guinness in the role which was great. Regarding the inspiration of The Hidden Fortress, you see how the story and characters were heavily inspired. The two peasants from that film who banter with each other throughout the movie, you see their personalities in R2D2 and 3CPO. Then we have the samurai and princess, Jedi and Princess in this film. Another big influence was of course Flash Gordon but I'll go into another one, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots. There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes. He uses this inspiration and creates something brilliant, something memorable, a landmark in cinema. One big reason for why it's so memorable, is because of the production design and art direction, it's truly something special, with Ralph McQuarrie's concept art and illustrations helping make Star Wars so special and epic.This film, the first Star Wars film, has some mesmerizing shots. The film looks absolutely stunning and it's thanks to the brilliant cinematography by Gilbert Taylor along with the director. George Lucas had a new camera made for the film for the extensive special effects shots. Dykstra's development of this first digital motion control camera system earned himself, Al Miller, and Jerry Jeffress Academy Awards in 1978. If I would have been at the cinema during the theatrical release, I would have been completely mind blown of the special effects, they have aged like fine wine. The film is almost fifty years old and it'll hold up in fifty more years. John Williams' musical score makes the film so much better, it's not the best score in the trilogy though but what he contributed to the film will be remembered for centuries.Roger Ebert said this in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, ""What makes the Star Wars experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie-violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark's jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in Star Wars (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize."" and called the film ""an out-of-body experience"", compared its special effects to those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and opined that the true strength of the film was its ""pure narrative"". The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. Star Wars won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. The film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, and Best Writing for George Lucas; Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness. Star Wars - A New Hope attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation which is a great achievement.Some final words for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I fell in love with this franchise and film when I was a kid thanks to my father. Star Wars remains a film, a trilogy, a franchise which I keep coming back to without feeling bored. I'm grateful for what George Lucas created, of all the young lives he changed. A New Hope is a brilliant film, a sci-fi film perfect in so many ways. For the ones who have never seen Star Wars before, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and still do.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539320/?ref_=tt_urv
6,29. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0103064,James Cameron + Arnold Schwarzenegger = an unbeatable combination,"The Governator is back - and this time around, his Terminator (who still isn't much of a conversationalist) is the good guy.The plot is fairly similar: Terminator goes back in time to kill John Connor (after failing to kill his mother in the first film) and Arnold's reformed/reprogrammed bad guy is sent back by future John Connor to save the world by stopping Judgement Day.Arnold's Terminator is perfectly humanised through his interactions with Edward Furlong's young John Connor.The new prototype Terminator is played by Robert Patrick, with the same unsmiling face and lack of words. He portrays a menacing villain, drawing from Arnold's original performance of seven years earlier.T2, a 90's actioner through and through, is fantastic from the word go: spectacular action sequences that manage to be bigger and bolder than the first film - which is really saying something - some funny moments, a dash of sci-fi, a cool soundtrack, perfect storyline, and brilliant direction from James Cameron. (Side note: Arnie's best work is generally under Cameron's guidance.)",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540057/?ref_=tt_urv
7,30. Spider-man: Across the Spider-verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt9362722,A Visually Stunning and Compelling Sequel,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film! First off, it is visually stunning, and it's evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into its creation. The visuals alone tell a compelling story of characters' emotions and set the tone for each scene. The cast, much like in the previous film, delivers outstanding performances, with Hailee Steinfeld particularly standing out in this one. The character progression of Miles from the first movie is a highlight, especially as the film places him at a crossroads. The soundtrack is among the best in recent memory, leaving a lasting impact even after the credits roll. The exploration of family themes is well-executed, although the second half slightly dips in this regard for the reviewer. The only downside I have is that much of the film's advertisement centered around the second half, which created a sense of having seen a huge portion of it already. The film also ends somewhat abruptly, but this is expected from the first part of a series. Overall, it stands as one of the best comic films to date in my opinion, and I think anyone could give it a watch, whether or not they enjoy superhero content.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540660/?ref_=tt_urv

9,42. The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0482571,The ending falls flat,"This movie is a fantastic presentation of sacrifice in rivalries and losing everything over an obsession, the question of 'How?' leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout, and while that curiosity was answered, it led into a strange sci-fi turn that I think destroys the whole premise of magicians being an 'illusion' and, as shown throughout the movie, people knowing that its a con, but wanting to believe as a source of wonder and amazement. The twist and revelation of Christian Bale's character was unexpected and teased unknowingly throughout the film and while the 'twin' reveal may be a little cliche I think it was done amazingly and really showed how something so simple can torment. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman's twist was, as I mentioned earlier, drifting into the supernatural and, funnily enough, I had a prediction that was almost exact to the twist but thought it unbelievable and a poor plot so it was discarded.Overall, 'The Prestige' is definitely worth watching but It does leave you feeling a little unsatisfied afterwards.The acting is amazing - as is the cast, and living the suspense with both characters instead of dramatic irony is really quite unique and exhilarating.7.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530923/?ref_=tt_urv
10,52. Alien,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0078748,Alien (1979): A Sci-Fi Masterpiece That Still Sends Shivers - A Must Watch Classic!,"Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, is a timeless science fiction gem that continues to captivate audiences even decades after its release. This film stands as a testament to the brilliance of the genre, delivering an intense and thrilling experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat.The headline ""A Must-Watch Classic!"" perfectly encapsulates the impact and significance of Alien in the cinematic landscape. This movie is a pioneer in the science fiction genre, setting a benchmark for the countless films that followed. Its influence can still be felt in today's science fiction offerings.The film's strength lies in its ability to create an atmosphere of unrelenting tension. From the moment the crew of the Nostromo sets foot on the eerie planet, the sense of impending doom is palpable. Ridley Scott masterfully builds suspense, using every dark corner, creaking sound, and haunting score to keep the audience gripped throughout.One of the most iconic aspects of Alien is undoubtedly the creature design. H. R. Giger's nightmarish creation, the xenomorph, remains one of the most terrifying and visually striking creatures ever put on screen. Its sleek, biomechanical appearance combined with its relentless pursuit of the crew members creates an unforgettable antagonist that has become a staple in pop culture.The cast of Alien is also worth praising, with Sigourney Weaver delivering a career-defining performance as the resourceful and determined Ellen Ripley. Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is a trailblazing representation of a strong female lead in a genre that was often dominated by men. The supporting cast, including Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Ian Holm, all contribute to the film's authenticity and emotional depth.Furthermore, the film's practical effects and set designs are nothing short of exceptional. The claustrophobic interiors of the Nostromo and the eerie alien spaceship feel lived-in and believable, immersing the audience in this dystopian future. This attention to detail enhances the overall experience, making every moment feel genuine and impactful.While some may argue that the film's pacing is slow at times, it is precisely this deliberate pacing that allows the tension to simmer and build to a crescendo. Alien is not just about the scares; it is a thought-provoking exploration of humanity's vulnerability in the face of the unknown, the horrors that lurk in the darkness, and the strength of the human spirit when faced with unimaginable danger.In addition to its masterful storytelling and technical achievements, Alien also delves into deeper themes and subtext. It explores the concept of corporate greed and the exploitation of workers, serving as a critique of capitalism and the devaluation of human life in the pursuit of profit. These underlying themes elevate the film beyond a mere creature feature, making it a truly thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating experience.The cinematography in Alien is breathtaking, with Ridley Scott utilizing lighting and shadow to create a sense of unease and mystery. The use of practical effects, such as the chestburster scene, remains groundbreaking and shocking even by today's standards. The combination of stunning visuals, a haunting score, and exceptional editing all come together to create an immersive and unforgettable cinematic experience.It is worth noting that Alien may not be suitable for all viewers due to its intense and graphic nature. The film does not shy away from gore and body horror, which may be unsettling for some. However, for those who can appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship behind the film, Alien is an absolute must-watch.In conclusion, Alien is a true masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Its groundbreaking creature design, intense atmosphere, and thought-provoking themes make it a landmark film in the science fiction genre. With its unforgettable performances, stunning visuals, and relentless tension, Alien remains a must-watch classic for any cinephile or sci-fi enthusiast.

Seeing how popular these films are and since I had watched the marvel spiderman films too I thought I should watch the animated films.

This action-packed and suspenseful film not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every aspect, delivering an unforgettable cinematic experience.Set several decades after the events of the first film, Aliens immerses us in a future where humans have colonized other planets.

However, this film from start to finish is pure brilliance! From the horrible realisation that all is lost after killing Thanos, to Tony making the ultimate sacrifices. The final battle has it all, and the ""Avenger Assemble"" battle cry gives me goose pimples every time! I have watched this movie countless times and could do so countless more as it is a true modern day classic.It's sad that we have to say goodbye to incredible characters like Tony, Natasha (not including her solo Black Widow film made after endgame) and Steve as they were part of the fundamental core of the Avengers. But with them gone new heroes have stepped up to take the mantle. For me this will always be a 10* star and my favourite of all time.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540172/?ref_=tt_urv

I want to revise such a film, not episodes 7-9... That's where the story should have ended and not continued!I would not say that there are more impressions than from the fifth episode, it is still darker and better.

It's not easy to narrate such a story and plot using limited equipements, moving from one time to another, but it was beautifully presented and you could easily understand when and how things happened.It is very enjoyable and every scene is important, you cannot miss one. And I love the plot twist, how it began from the ending, and how different you see them now even if you already watched the scene before.What I loved the most is the concept and idea behind it. It can be interpreted in different ways but what I felt just really hit me.Love is beautiful. It is painfully beautiful. You fall in love with someone, but the process of falling in love is what makes it special. You discover yourself, what you like, what you hate. You change, maybe for the worse but it doesn't matter, because you're living the best time of your life, experiencing love again. You might go through hell or not know what you're doing in a relationship, but love is the only beautiful thing in relationships, because everyone is f up and lost.I loved the ending, when they both knew and were sure of how their relationship ended, however they still wanted to be together and do it all over again, they still wanted to fall for each other, they still wanted pain for the sake of love, because it's worth it.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537569/?ref_=tt_urv
18,95. 2001: A Space Odyssey,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0062622,NOT a masterpiece,"This movie was just plain awful!! I feel the people that rated this a 10 just want to feel they are superior over others by sounding they were able to get from this terrible movie something so much more then what it was. Now, this was visually good, colour sequences were nice, musical score was good, however 2.5 hours for all that is insanely boring and just plain torture at times! At the 1 hour 10 minute mark, you have a scene of the astronaut go out into space, then for 6 and a half minutes there is just what can only be described as the sound of a pressure cooker whistling constantly! After 3 minutes of this I almost wanted to poke sharp instruments into my ears to stop that sound from making my brain feel like was about to explode! The movie is just filled with endless silence, or repetitive sounds that for the most part were just annoying after 10 to 15 seconds, funny enough, some of these irritating sounds caused my dogs to react and start looking around and have to leave the area. Dialogue is very minimal through entire movie, instead this movie is just filled with instrumental musical score in all the spots not in silence or with annoying sounds.Then the plot is not really clear, besides a computer named Hal being evil all for the mission, which at that point it turns on the 2 astronauts, not sure if the attempt was to be comedic, or just ended up being like that, but Hal starts to tell the astronaut he is better now, and to please talk to him, (at least it cracked a smile from me).One of the worst movies I have ever saw, and frustrating that is so highly rated and so many people spewing out comments of how brilliant of a movie this is! Then that lightshow moment late in the movie, I get it was 1969, but c'mon, I felt I was in a lava lamp at some point!.This should of been an old Twilight Zone episode from the 1950's, 20 minutes would probably of been enough to get the point across of this treaded 2.5 hours masterflop!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540092/?ref_=tt_urv

Why and who needs this?These things are taught in school and some people understand them even before that.I certainly don't recommend this film to anyone because you would only be disgusted by its existence.It's certainly not for children either though, because the scenes it contains are next level simplicity, and in a negative sense. They are something we see every day on the news and even in everyday life, and we don't need someone to show us how a person would think if they were brainwashed.

Metropolis,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0017136,Masterpiece,"This is not a real review, it should be understood more as a collection of impressions on the film.Fritz Lang's masterpiece, a silent film which however is not for everyone obviously because it takes a lot of patience and attention, I'm not saying that the film is boring, on the contrary it is extremely interesting and entertaining, but it is not for everyone because it takes a lot cinematographic culture to appreciate a masterpiece of the genre. The film in general is therefore extremely worth following but it is one of those films to absolutely watch as it is a milestone in cinematography, one of those films that have made the history of this art and therefore classified among those impossible not to watch.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539114/?ref_=tt_urv
