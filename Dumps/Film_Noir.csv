1,60. Sunset Blvd.,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0043014,Billy Wilder illuminates the flip side of celebrity and movie stardom,"In what was one of Hollywood's first indictments of itself, faded silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) offers young, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) the opportunity to stay with her in her lavish, antiquated mansion, where she lives in recluse, dreaming of her bygone days as one of the once budding industry's brightest stars - and hoping that her latest script will give her one last taste of the fame she's incurably addicted to. Billy Wilder illuminates the flip side of celebrity and movie stardom with shrewdness and doubtless first-hand knowledge. But after 70 years of aging, Sunset Boulevard only fully works on that allegorical level. The rest of the movie, with its looming tragedy and noirish shadows, is a little too plotted and melodramatic to really resonate, despite - or perhaps partly because - Swanson's outlandish performance as the ageing diva. She's a ghost of the expressionist traditions she was brought up in, and she's blind to the fact that she's become a parody of her own screen-persona. As the picture revels in this parody, with sprinkles of black comedy which alas are too slight and far between, it does still create its own atmospheric realm that partly explains Joe's lunacy. Thanks to Wilder's skill and an invested William Holden, Sunset Boulevard transports you back to 1950's Hollywood and gives you a fascinating glimpse into its world of theatricality, decline and debauchery.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537240/?ref_=tt_urv
2,104. Double Indemnity,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0036775,Double Indemnity is Outstanding Film Noir,"The chemistry and charisma of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray smolder and ignite in this classic film noir about a murder for insurance money scheme gone wrong. Expertly filmed and fast-paced, Double Indemnity draws the audience into the swirl of passion, fantasies of riches, and evil plans that unravel faster than the heated passion it took to cook them up in the first place.Barbara Stanwyck brings just the right combination of looks, smarts and emotional manipulation to the role as the wife who wants her husband dead. The audience sees insurance agent/Stanwyck stooge Fred MacMurray's detached and cynical facade shift as he turns into a calculating plotter of murder, followed by his helpless entrapment as the walls close in by unexpected circumstances as the insurance scheme unravels.In his role as MacMurray's boss, Edward G. Robinson's cunning realization that the supposed accident staged for a huge insurance payout was a fraud all along adds a fiery and intellectual topping to this movie.Expertly and intricately plotted, and yet presented in a logical, coherent way the audience can follow, this film is a must see for any fan of Billy Wilder productions and the art and drama of cinema.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536297/?ref_=tt_urv
3,200. The Third Man,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0041959,Still one of the best in the genre,"December 2023. Watching this 4k restauration confirms that this masterpiece has not aged a day. Just still speechless. The acting, the images and, indeed, the soundtrack are just perfect. Nothing to do with the version I saw in the fifties which was so truncated that it was hard to understand what was going on. Fortunately I saw it again in the Musée du Cinéma at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in a much better version. Then I really thought that it was a masterpiece. Watching it now confirms that I was not wrong at the time. Looks like I still need 40 characters to be eligible with this review. So I will finish with two words: Forever Outstanding.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9529179/?ref_=tt_urv
4,242. Rebecca,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0032976,An exceptional film.,"A really superb romantic thriller released in 1940. The film shot in black and white and in a 4:3 aspect ratio still looks gorgeous and really is one you can't take your eyes off. I think this might be my favourite British film of all time. It's also I think arguably the greatest love story on film, with Brief Encounter the only other option. The film deserves so much praise for the set design, the excellent script, Lawrence Olivier is brilliant as a lonely troubled widower when we first meet him, rich, aristocratic yet sorrowful and distant it's all there in the performance, the way he carries himself, it's sublime. The costumes all look extremely pleasing yet also modern and real, the film also takes you back to a day of manners and a strict social class system where the rich might spend there days at Monte Carlo while a keen sense of hierarchy is preserved back in there stately homes. You really feel and care for our main character, superbly played by Joan Fontaine who seems so earnest, insecure and caring yet so full of self doubt too and so often made to feel inadequate by those around her, either deliberately or accidently. The film constantly raises the question of who's in charge, one character seems to not so much ask as tell her what will happen next around the house. The film makes great use of light and shadow to hint at the mystery in the story and the internal conflict within the character. The beautiful house at times feel overwhelmingly large and intimidating and at times empty. The film later turns into more a crime thriller with great tension between the characters who also have great conflict within themselves, there's just so much happening in every scene. Big twists come, the characters become more morally grey but also more interesting, our new young wife assumes a stronger more protective personality while another charming but slightly threating man appears on the scene and is given all the best lines. Secrets are revealed but then struggled to conceal leading to greater tension yet. A scene involving a huge fire also looks magnificent near the end.The acting, cinematography and story cannot be praised enough. Both Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are incredible in this movie, playing two of the greatest characters I've seen on screen. I finally get what all they hype was about with Olivier.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9518300/?ref_=tt_urv
