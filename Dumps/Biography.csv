1,6. Schindler's List,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0108052,The profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust,"""Schindler's List"" is a profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust and an ode to the power of individual conscience and compassion in the face of unfathomable evil. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a hauntingly poignant portrayal of one man's transformation from opportunist to savior amidst the atrocities of World War II.The story follows Oskar Schindler, a German businessman brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson, who initially seeks to profit from the war by employing Jewish labor in his factories. However, as he witnesses the systematic persecution and genocide of Jews under Nazi rule, Schindler undergoes a moral awakening. His efforts to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish workers, guided by his accountant Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley), become an act of defiance against the inhumanity of the Holocaust.Spielberg's direction captures the harrowing realities of the Holocaust with unflinching authenticity, employing black and white cinematography to evoke a haunting sense of history. The film's stark visuals, coupled with John Williams' haunting score, create an emotionally immersive experience that leaves an indelible impact on the audience.What sets ""Schindler's List"" apart is its unwavering portrayal of both the depths of human cruelty and the glimmer of hope found in acts of altruism. It's a narrative that confronts the darkest chapters of history while honoring the resilience and humanity of those who resisted.The performances, especially Neeson's portrayal of Schindler's gradual transformation from a profiteer to a savior, resonate with emotional depth. The supporting cast adds layers of authenticity to the characters, showcasing the resilience and tragedy of those caught in the Holocaust's grip.Beyond its cinematic achievements, ""Schindler's List"" serves as a powerful educational tool, a stark reminder of the consequences of hate and the importance of standing up against injustice. Its impact extends far beyond the screen, challenging viewers to confront the atrocities of the past and champion compassion and tolerance in the present.Decades after its release, the film remains a cinematic landmark-a testament to the filmmaker's dedication to preserving history and telling stories that transcend entertainment, leaving an enduring legacy as a powerful, emotionally raw portrayal of one of humanity's darkest chapters.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534449/?ref_=tt_urv
2,17. GoodFellas,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0099685,"Goodfellas: A Cinematic Rollercoaster Through Mob Life, Scorsese's Masterpiece Earns a Solid 8/10 for Its Intensity and Timeless Appeal","Goodfellas, an 8, dude! Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the mob world, and it's a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and raw. De Niro and Pesci are like the OGs of the gangster game, bringing the characters to life with an unmatched intensity.The storytelling is on point - it's like you're in on the heists, the schemes, and the betrayals. The soundtrack, bro, it's a mixtape of classic hits that elevate the whole vibe. From 'Layla' during the helicopter scene to 'Gimme Shelter' in the aftermath, it's a symphony of crime and chaos. The camera work, especially the famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, is pure genius - a rollercoaster through the glitz and grit of the mob life.Sure, it's not a perfect 10 because some parts drag a bit, but that doesn't take away from the overall ride. 'Goodfellas' is like a cinematic rollercoaster - fast, intense, and a bit dangerous. It's a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of mob life without the consequences. A solid 8 because it's a classic that stands the test of time, leaving you with a mix of awe and a twisted appreciation for the mob's twisted world.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536253/?ref_=tt_urv
3,33. The Pianist,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0253474,Haunting WWII film.,"Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522421/?ref_=tt_urv

5,68. Oppenheimer,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt15398776,Complicated Theatrical Rendition of a Complicated Individual,"With Oppenheimer, his first biopic, writer/director Christopher Nolan once again proves he's up to the challenge of balancing a difficult subject matter with a very tricky character piece. The slow, careful process of scientific discovery is rarely friendly to film, and shy, socially-awkward introverts do not often make for compelling leads, but in this case Nolan juggles both and steps away smelling like roses. As he'd already done on more than one occasion, in decidedly different flavors.Here we track the career of a famed theoretical physicist, thrust into the limelight as the so-called ""father of the atom bomb"" during the crush of World War 2 and then dismissed by an ungrateful government after he'd outlived his usefulness and started asking difficult follow-up questions. Oppenheimer's frustrated early career, meteoric rise to fame and equally rapid fall from grace are depicted almost simultaneously, in a rush of confused, overlapped memories. This style of all-at-once storytelling, in which foreshadowing coexists with its own outcome, is reminiscent of the time-blurred motifs we've already seen in Tenet, Inception and Dunkirk. Here it serves as a compelling way to digest a lot of information in a very short amount of time, especially when paired with a head-spinning series of metaphorical visual effects and an entrancing musical score. I've read the book this film was based upon, a daunting 800-page tome, and after the first hour I felt like I'd just read most of it all over again. This time with a little extra dramatic pizazz.It's an impressive display of top-notch filmmaking, proficiently depicting a historical scenario in which everyone already knows the ending and climaxing with a tense, powerful visualization of the Trinity tests which first loosed the power of violent nuclear fission upon the world. I loved every moment, but then, I was already deeply invested in the subject and had done some homework. My wife, far less prepared, was also far less enchanted. I think this may be more of a knock on Oppenheimer the man than Oppenheimer the film. A complicated, often misguided individual who, for all his brilliance within the hidden world of molecular physics, was inherently flawed and broken in a human sense. Nolan makes no apology for this, baring the person (and his many blemishes) to the screen with no filter, and the results aren't always pretty.Perhaps a bit too long, especially in the painfully bitter, sixty-minute postscript, but I'm not sure where I'd want to see a cut. Certainly not a feel-good audience pleaser, Nolan's latest is an exhausting experience, but also rich, thoughtful and rewarding.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9541184/?ref_=tt_urv
6,75. Amadeus,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0086879,characters act to the music love it.,"I like this movie even if I didn't like how the wife performance filled a bit flat most of the time and I had to remember that this was based on a conspiracy theory and it's not real history even if it has a lot of real history in it.Interpreting I didn't really know who to root for but slowly I realized that villain composer was really entertaining and enjoyed every morni. He has of his speechos spiteful relationship with Mozart it is just so fun to ride him torture this guy who totally does not deserve it.And that portrayal of Mozart was really good. In the beginning I hated him I wanted him to suffer because he was such an insufferable break, but I begin to get sympathy for him and he was really sad when he slowly got tortured .What I enjoyed most about the performances was how over the top they could be like. Seeing the most angry Frau on a person and Mozart making the most hilarious laughs. It just went to 10 most of the time which were amazing for this time period because it feels like it was a play for how what's the top everything was.The way the characters act to the music love it. They want every minute of it. I could feel it and I enjoyed classic. I never like before because of their reaction to it.Please watch it even if it is 3 hours Long.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523660/?ref_=tt_urv
7,78. Braveheart,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0112573,It's a Subjective Thing,"The Academy loves awarding splashy historical flicks with good stories about people living for ideals with Best Pucture Oscars. ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart.""Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on.""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace.The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy.Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9531241/?ref_=tt_urv
8,98. Lawrence of Arabia,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0056172,Sensational,"The music and picture quality in this epic are both outstanding, truly excellent, practically every actor was perfectly cast in their roles maybe with the exception of Alex Guinness, I'd have preferred an Arab actor there. The sets and locations looked authentic and real, the scope of the film was immense. The film was shot in location in Jordan I believe and follows the true story of a British officer who helped leads to Arabs to revolt against the Turks during WWI, fighting with guerrilla tactics. The film also explores the darker side of war, what it can do to an ordinary person's mind. The film is also not afraid to touch upon the imperial ambitions of the British leadership and how their version of the of the Middle East after WWI looks a little different the one Lawrence expects. The film's cinematography is extraordinary and the scope of the story is breath-taking. This is not just a great war movie or biopic but is now widely considered one of the greatest movies every made.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9515489/?ref_=tt_urv

It is everything that's perfect in live. I've heard people trashing lin manuel miranda for his voucd but they're wrong. He sounds great. Davies dings and Renee elise Goldberg both have vocals that are out of this world.I heard a lot of people also complaining about how the casting is not true to the actors nationalty and to that I say who cares. Thomas jefferson, who was obviously a white man being played by daveed diggs was a brilliant choice and honestly he hard carried the second act.

10,125. Der Untergang,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0363163,This is a must-watch movie...,"With his 2004 movie ""Der Untergang"" (aka ""Downfall""), director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered quite an amazing movie. This is such a hard-hitting movie and one that most definitely deserves to be seen, regardless of you having an interest in World War II or not. Why? Well, because it is a powerful story and one that proves that history must never be forgotten.Writer Bernd Eichinger put together a powerful and memorable script and story, based on the books by Joachim Fest, Traudl Junge and Melissa Müller. The storyline told in ""Der Untergang"" is one that will stick with you for a long time.I am really amazed with the storytelling in ""Der Untergang"", because director Oliver Hirschbiegel takes the audience along on a very emotional journey throughout the 156 minutes that the movie runs for. You might think that 156 minutes is a long runtime, but it actually is not, because the story is so nicely told, so interesting and so encompassing that you just get swept up and carried along the narrative as it unfolds and shows the last days of the regime of Adolf Hitler and the end of his Third Reich.Leading actor Bruno Ganz, playing Adolf Hitler, puts on such an amazing performance in this movie that it is hard not to be impressed. Bruno Ganz's performance in ""Der Untergang"" is so powerful that his performance alone makes the movie well-worth watching. In fact, the entire cast ensemble in the movie put on great performances individually, and that really added so much to the overall presentation of the movie.""Der Untergang"" is a movie that leaves quite an impression upon the viewer.And the fact that everything is kept in German, and some Russian language as well, makes it all the more believable and authentic. If this movie was dubbed, it would be an affront to writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel.The costume and props departments worked their magic to make ""Der Untergang"" look and feel like a proper World War II movie, which definitely was a crucial factor for the overall impact of the movie. It looks and feels the way it is supposed to, and that kind of authenticism really makes all the difference.If you haven't already seen ""Der Untergang"", then you most certainly should do so, should you get the chance. This is a must-watch movie.My rating of ""Der Untergang"" lands on a nine out of ten stars.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521153/?ref_=tt_urv

12,130. The Wolf of Wall Street,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0993846,Hilariously great,"(9.5 but rounding up) The comedy The Wolf of Wall Street is a hilarious movie that has me laughing every second. Jordan Belfort, protagonist played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a young stock broker in wall street. As he starts working and making a name for himself and learning the in and outs of the stock market he meets Donnie Azzoff, best friend played by Jonah Hill, and together they start their own Stock broking business. I was surprised about how funny this movie would be. Originally I believed it would be mostly informing and explaining a lot about the stock market but it really showed that their is not that much to know. It showed many behind the scenes moments regarding the stock market and the luck behind it. Overall one of the best movies I've ever seen with great actors and comedy.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537033/?ref_=tt_urv

Anyway, A Beautiful Mind also stars Christopher Plummer, whom Crowe starred with in The Insider a couple of years before A Beautiful Mind.If A Beautiful Mind is remade then I nominate acclaimed British actor Danny Dyer to play John Nash.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538944/?ref_=tt_urv
15,156. The Elephant Man,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0080678,a tortured soul with the heart of a poet.,"A beautiful film with stark black and white cinematography, brilliant performances from John Hurt and Antony Hopkins. The film has an old school 1940s style to it, with not a lot of soundtrack, a slight hissing sound, limited use of music and some amazing production design taking you back to Victorian England. The themes of the film are about kindness and cruelty. Mr Merrick throughout the film learns to recover his humanity, a tortured soul with the heart of a poet.The screenplay is also excellent and the film is superbly directed and looks brilliant in 4K.The camera movement is kept fairly traditional, avoiding a lot of handheld shots, weird angles or sweeping overhead shots in favour of a much more classical style you find in older films. One notable exception is a long amazing tracking shot in a train station. The sound design is also superb.This isn't just one of the best films from the 1980s but one of the best films of all time. Every cast member does a perfect job.If I had to say anything negative about the film it would be it does take plenty of artistic license with the truth.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521068/?ref_=tt_urv

His acting immerses you in the character of Manoj and makes you eagerly wait for the time he becomes an IPS. Besides, kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra for not only choosing this story, but also bringing this masterpiece to the audience with a brilliant screenplay and realistic direction.

18,176. Catch Me If You Can,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0264464,The Ultimate Con Man,"This movie was fun to watch. It's a rewatch but I watched it so many years ago it needed a rewatch before it left Netflix. Young Dicaprio was such a good cast for this role although the real Frank Abagnale was not quite as charming. Any movie with Leo is a plus for me. The score done by John Williams was very good and I was appreciative of the several jazz tracks they used throughout the film. Christopher Walken was also very good in his supporting role and you can see the influence he had on in his junior. The whole movie is great (perhaps even a 4.5) as long as you suspend your disbelief which became very hard to do.The movie for many years was thought as based on true story but recent investigations have suggested that most of the movie, which is based on Abagnale's autobiography, is false and fabricated. It's a type of story so unrealistic and movie-like that it can only work if it actually happened. But this knowledge made the movie a little pointless in hindsight and only confirmed the impossibility of such scams done by Abagnale.Outside of the thrilling moments portrayed by Dicaprio's charm, this movie shows you why you shouldn't get divorced. Look how a normal kid turned into a con man in a matter of days. Perhaps the biggest con that Abagnale pulled off is making the world believe that you are biggest con man and profit off of it. It's truly a great gimmick and I respect him for running that. At the very least, he's a good story writer/teller, which means something.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534846/?ref_=tt_urv

In this heartbreaking film, we not only see some of the horrors that people of color have had to endure, but also the perseverance of my people.For anyone who finds themselves in a difficult position, choose a motivation, such as Solomon.

20,190. Hacksaw Ridge,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2119532,Great WWII story,"The story fits nicely into 3 acts, the introduction, the training and finally the combat sequences. The real strength of the film lies in it's final act, the direction is superb as we the audience are hurled into the hell of battle, all it's trauma, fear, brutality and horror. I couldn't think of a single bad performance and the supporting cast are all actually quite well developed given the limited time we have to get to know them. The story is about Desmond Doss a straight-talking high minded individual who simultaneously pursues a romantic engagement and tries to enlist in the army while refusing to take up arms, wishing instead to serve as a medic. He freely admits to being a consciousness objector, his convictions are of course mistaken for cowardice and every obstacle is thrown in front of him in an effort to get him out.The film course boasts very high production values and the close quarter fighting sequences have to be seen to be believed. I fully recommend the Blu Ray experience despite the dull colour scheme in the third act, with it's grey, brown and green colours, together with it's smoky backdrop and handheld camera work the visuals none the less are atoningly good. In close ups every scratch on a helmet is Clearly seen as is every tiny speck of dried blood on a person's forehead. The art department deserve full credit for their work. The score is what you'd expect from this genera of film of war and heroism and the sound design is probably more important than the visuals in portraying the terrors of battle. The only moment shots which looked a little unreal were the CGI ships of the US navy, other than that everything seems to blend seamlessly. Another slight problem is that in the chaos of the fast paced fighting it's hard to tell who is who.Films these days about war often like to explore the grey areas, the moral challenges it presents to a characters ideas of right or wrong, Fury being one such example.. It's refreshing then for a film to be coming back with a sense that personal values and convictions can withstand the grim reality of war. It could also be seen as a challenge to secular ideas that religious objections should carry little to no weight in the eyes of the law and it's country. Desmond was able to make an incredible personal contribution exactly because his beliefs were made allowance for.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9514074/?ref_=tt_urv
