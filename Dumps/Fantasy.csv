1,7. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0167260,THE BEST OF ALL TIME,"Visually, ""The Return of the King"" is a marvel. The grandiose landscapes, intricate costumes and breathtaking special effects create a world that is both magical and authentic. The attention to detail in depicting the different cultures and creatures of Middle-earth is simply remarkable.What really sets this film apart is its emotional depth. The characters face unimaginable trials, testing their determination and loyalty. Themes of friendship, courage and the struggle between good and evil are addressed with such sincerity that they resonate deeply with audiences. The performances, particularly those by actors like Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen, are incredibly moving, allowing viewers to connect deeply with the characters.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538575/?ref_=tt_urv

This film cannot get any better than what it already is. Sheer perfection, commendable performances and amazing way to coven the story within the cinema timelines.Nowhere did the film felt dragged or slow, which I was worried it might. It's a viewer spectacle at it's best.Even if you haven't read the book, go ahead and watch this movie.

3,13. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0167261,Damn.....,"This movie was definitely not as good as the first film, but damn was it still good. I remember watching this as a kid and not understanding anything but still liked it. And now that ive grown i absolutely love it, the character development of frodo and of Aragorn is just so good. Gandalf becoming gandalf the white was so sick, and the overall fantasy element is top tier. The only thing that is really an L in this film is the developing love of the princess (forgot her name) and Aragorn. Like i personally dont see it and it seems forced. I would understand him leaving the elf girl, since it was inevitable and he genuinely loved her and did what was best for her, but the relarionship with the princess? Not really liking it. Its a very small complaint and very picky. Other than that, great film. 100% recommend.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538687/?ref_=tt_urv
4,15. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0080684,The best Star Wars film of all time,"The Empire Strikes Back is arguably more Space Opera than science fiction, but whatever it is, it's damned fine entertainment and highly re-watchable. The physical and meta-physical training of farm-boy Luke is an important part of this film, and Yoda amazes -- the only Muppet ever to seem like an organic being and not a puppet.""Do. Or do not. There is no try.""SO many things could have gone wrong with this ambitious project, and none of them did. Like the best Star Wars films, the final shot is moving and has great music (the entire soundtrack is excellent).10/10 -- I don't give out this rating lightly (esp. For a sequel).",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536391/?ref_=tt_urv
5,20. It's a Wonderful Life,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0038650,"It's a Wonderful Life: A Timeless 9/10 Classic, Jimmy Stewart's Stellar Performance and Emotional Depth Make it a Cinematic Gem for Every Generation.","It's a Wonderful Life, a solid 9, man! This classic might be in black and white, but don't let that fool you - it's a timeless emotional journey. Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is iconic, capturing the struggles and triumphs of an everyday man. The plot, centered around the 'what if' scenario of George never being born, weaves a narrative that tugs at the heartstrings, making you reflect on the impact of one individual's life on an entire community.The supporting cast adds layers of depth, and Clarence the angel brings a quirky charm to the whole 'guardian angel' concept. The small-town setting oozes nostalgia, and the film's messages about family, friendship, and the value of a single life are powerful. Despite being an older film, the themes are relevant, and the storytelling remains captivating, leaving you with a warm and fuzzy feeling long after the credits roll.Sure, some might find it a bit sentimental, but that's the magic of 'It's a Wonderful Life.' It's a cinematic gem that not only stands the test of time but continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. A 9/10 because it's a heartwarming journey that reminds us of the profound impact our lives can have on those around us, and sometimes, it takes a bit of cinematic magic to appreciate the wonderfulness of life.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540888/?ref_=tt_urv
6,27. The Green Mile,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0120689,A movie that you will never forget,"I love The Green Mile for a multitude of reasons. First it is a three hour movie that never gets boring, second it has great writing that is comparable to The Dark Knight, and third the characters are lovable and you actually care about them. The acting from both Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan was excellent and you could tell that they actually wanted this movie to succeed. It is a very somber film that you will remember for years. I think this is one of the rare moments when the movie was better than the source material. I hope that years later this movie will be remembered as one of the best movies ever made.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536750/?ref_=tt_urv
7,28. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0076759,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a flawed masterpiece, an adventure you won't forget that pushed the boundaries of special effects - My Ultimate Review","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a sci-fi masterpiece, although it has some flaws it's just easy to look past. This is a Star Wars film I've seen more times than I can count and now it's my second time seeing it on 4K Blu-ray, honestly, each frame looks stunning and is full of detail. This is one of those 4k remasters which is simply perfect with Dolby Vision and HDR which enhances the experience and picture quality immensely. The Dolby Atmos track is too perfect, making it easy to understand why the film won an award for best sound and music. George Lucas directed and wrote the film, also creating ILM for the extensive special effects work on the film. It's a flawed masterpiece as with this film, you see the flaws that George clearly has, but how he went through with his vision and stuck with it. We got one of the best sci-fi films and possibly the best sci-fi franchise thanks to him, a storyteller and visionary. Star Wars was a surprise hit, surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time.Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a Wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle station, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the mysterious Darth Vader.There's a ton of likable characters in this trilogy (Episode IV-VI) and this was the start. We have an inexperienced Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker, what's interesting is how you see his acting improve throughout the film. Then we have Harrison Ford as the charismatic Han Solo who gets all the funny lines which are made funny because of his delivery. His performance is one of the highlights, I could say the same about Hamill and Fisher's who got a career after this film. We have Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa, Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca. On the villain side we have; Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, David Prowse as Darth Vader with James Earl Jones doing the voice for the character, a voice a bit unknown back in the day, but a voice that became iconic. The characters are excellent and the acting can be all from good to average and even below average at times, but that's completely alright with a film with this much heart. I can't help to smile, laugh, and be entertained every single time I watch this film.It's known to the public how George Lucas was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's films, for example The Hidden Fortress with Toshiro Mifune being Lucas' number one pick for Obi-Wan Kenobi but it wasn't meant to be instead we got Alec Guinness in the role which was great. Regarding the inspiration of The Hidden Fortress, you see how the story and characters were heavily inspired. The two peasants from that film who banter with each other throughout the movie, you see their personalities in R2D2 and 3CPO. Then we have the samurai and princess, Jedi and Princess in this film. Another big influence was of course Flash Gordon but I'll go into another one, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots. There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes. He uses this inspiration and creates something brilliant, something memorable, a landmark in cinema. One big reason for why it's so memorable, is because of the production design and art direction, it's truly something special, with Ralph McQuarrie's concept art and illustrations helping make Star Wars so special and epic.This film, the first Star Wars film, has some mesmerizing shots. The film looks absolutely stunning and it's thanks to the brilliant cinematography by Gilbert Taylor along with the director. George Lucas had a new camera made for the film for the extensive special effects shots. Dykstra's development of this first digital motion control camera system earned himself, Al Miller, and Jerry Jeffress Academy Awards in 1978. If I would have been at the cinema during the theatrical release, I would have been completely mind blown of the special effects, they have aged like fine wine. The film is almost fifty years old and it'll hold up in fifty more years. John Williams' musical score makes the film so much better, it's not the best score in the trilogy though but what he contributed to the film will be remembered for centuries.Roger Ebert said this in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, ""What makes the Star Wars experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie-violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark's jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in Star Wars (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize."" and called the film ""an out-of-body experience"", compared its special effects to those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and opined that the true strength of the film was its ""pure narrative"". The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. Star Wars won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. The film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, and Best Writing for George Lucas; Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness. Star Wars - A New Hope attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation which is a great achievement.Some final words for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I fell in love with this franchise and film when I was a kid thanks to my father. Star Wars remains a film, a trilogy, a franchise which I keep coming back to without feeling bored. I'm grateful for what George Lucas created, of all the young lives he changed. A New Hope is a brilliant film, a sci-fi film perfect in so many ways. For the ones who have never seen Star Wars before, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and still do.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539320/?ref_=tt_urv
8,30. Spider-man: Across the Spider-verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt9362722,A Visually Stunning and Compelling Sequel,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film! First off, it is visually stunning, and it's evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into its creation. The visuals alone tell a compelling story of characters' emotions and set the tone for each scene. The cast, much like in the previous film, delivers outstanding performances, with Hailee Steinfeld particularly standing out in this one. The character progression of Miles from the first movie is a highlight, especially as the film places him at a crossroads. The soundtrack is among the best in recent memory, leaving a lasting impact even after the credits roll. The exploration of family themes is well-executed, although the second half slightly dips in this regard for the reviewer. The only downside I have is that much of the film's advertisement centered around the second half, which created a sense of having seen a huge portion of it already. The film also ends somewhat abruptly, but this is expected from the first part of a series. Overall, it stands as one of the best comic films to date in my opinion, and I think anyone could give it a watch, whether or not they enjoy superhero content.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540660/?ref_=tt_urv
9,32. Spirited Away,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0245429,A beautiful story with lovable characters,"I would argue that Spirited Away is my favourite Studio Ghibli film. A friend of mine introduced me to Ghibli through this movie when I was a kid and I cannot give higher praise.We follow the main character, Chihiro, a seemingly immature and needy child who finds herself in the world of kami. The plot revolves around her finding a way to free herself and her parents from this world and the witch Yubaba. The beauty of this protagonist is how much she changes from her experience in kami and the lessons she learns from the characters she meets along the way.Each character we meet has separate personalities and goals, and they each help Chihiro in one way or another, whether that is actively helping her and being a friend, or being an adversary. All of the characters are grey, with no real black or white, making characters more realistic and applicable to real life.The visual experience alone is gorgeous, the animation is flawless and captivating. The music is relaxing and captures the essence of the story.This film is excellent and I seriously suggest watching it in the original Japanese with subtitles. This is one Ghibli film that is much better in Japanese than the English dub.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539507/?ref_=tt_urv
10,63. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt4633694,Decent but not amazing,Ok so I finally decided to watch the immensely popular spiderman animated films and while I like an occasional superhero film I don't adore them. Seeing how popular these films are and since I had watched the marvel spiderman films too I thought I should watch the animated films. I had high expectations for this seeing how well received it had been and I actually enjoyed it. The animation is refreshing and original and the story is interesting but overall I find it pretty average. It's a decent film but it's not amazing. I would recommend it though it isn't bad but just overhyped in my opinion.,https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9528030/?ref_=tt_urv

Since early already is shown to the public how his family hates music, and also tells about the history of his grandpa and how asshole he was (as far as it had been shown). Beyond the whole history delevoped in the movie, also is shown indirectly the culture of Mexico and how the people lead with the death, what is in my opinion really beatifull. The art of this movie is fantastic, and the work well done with the soudtrack is unbelievable. I'm even now with the songs in my head, ""Remember me"", for example, depicts perfectly the relation of the protagonist with his grandma and what he feels about her.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9490136/?ref_=tt_urv

Tom Hanks in particular is brilliant in this, I simply loved his voice acting for Woody. The film generated a huge amount of excitement and comment at the time due to it's amazing animation but for me it's the story which comes first. The music in the film is great and fits very well whatever see going on in the different scenes. The whole idea of the toys having to keep their lives a secret from the humans was very clever too. The film is just a brilliant tale of jealousy, lost identity and friendship, huge themes for a kids film but it's all pulled off with such skill. A brilliant movie.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523311/?ref_=tt_urv
13,81. Mononoke-hime,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0119698,My favourite film of all time,"When I was young, this film was more of a beautiful spectacle of animation rather than a interesting plot. The art to this film is beyond any doubt one of the best in animation history. This alone could make me rate this a 10/10 film, many could argue movies like your name or suzume could surpass the art. Hayoa miyazi prides himself in hand drawn animation, as seen in most of his films, and this to me brings this movie up a lot.Beauty of art aside, the plot to this film is insane. Though the only negative I would have is how slow the beginning is, putting a lot of people off. A plot where the character is neither in the ""good"" or ""bad"" and rather helps everyone and is then seen of a bad guy from both sides. The good and bad side is completely the choice of the viewer (though most would be on princess mononokes side).The antagonist to this film is arguably the most ambiguous character in the film. Is she really evil for the pain she has put on the land, or is she a good person for the service and valour she has given to her own kind?Hayao miyazi also produces well thought out, powerful female characters with faults and development that many films these days lack.There is so much to unpack in this film its ridiculous.I would generally call this film one of the best. And I recommend it 100%",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538920/?ref_=tt_urv

Though it has lots of entertainment for children this is a film that adults can really appreciate too. The film had me and the rest of my family in stiches at times.

I want to revise such a film, not episodes 7-9... That's where the story should have ended and not continued!I would not say that there are more impressions than from the fifth episode, it is still darker and better.

It was a free option to watch on Tubi, so I figured I would go ahead and check it off my list. I'm so sorry that I didn't listen to my gut and skip it. The violence and cruelty of the film was more than I cared to endure. I was left feeling disturbed after watching the events of this movie take place. I understood this to be a fantasy film, but it felt more like a horror. The darkness of the themes were much more than I anticipated.

18,152. Monty Python and the Holy Grail,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0071853,And now for something completely irreverent.,"Monty Python was to comedy what the Beatles were to popular music....and not just because they too were British and had a member named John. Brilliant, absurdist, and audacious, the Oxford and Cambridge educated Pythons revolutionized television humor by bringing an intellectual edge to their uniquely satirical brand of comedy. Prior to the 1969 debut of Monty Python's Flying Circus, the public's idea of sketch comedy was Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In and the Carol Burnett Show. Some of Carol's skit ~especially Tim Conway's dentist~ hold up beautifully today, but Laugh-In is strictly a product of its era.What made Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, and the two Terrys (Jones and Gilliam) so groundbreaking was their take-no-prisoners approach. Bearing a style light-years removed from vaudeville, sacred cows were fair game for the Pythons as they fearlessly took on religion, sex, and other hallowed institutions....and made us absolutely howl with laughter!! Who can forget their classic argument skit? Or the funniest (and deadliest) joke in the world? Or the Ministry of Silly Walks?Unlike the Fab Four, the Pythons' exposure to American audiences was not the result of a single appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was a gradual experiment that began in, of all places, Texas....by which time the Flying Circus had ceased production. In 1971 the Pythons had released a feature film called AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, but in actuality it was a compendium of their zaniest sketches, which also included the Olympic hide and go seek event, the Blackmail game show, and, let us not forget, the upper class twit of the year.By 1975, the troupe had gained sufficient popularity to embark on their first bona-fide movie made strictly for the silver screen: MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. Like the Beatles' A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, this Fab Six didn't have a big budget to play around with, but they sure manage to make do with less! With Chapman playing the lead role of King Arthur, the others basked in playing so many multiple characters that would have made chameleons like Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers envious. The HOLY GRAIL script called for at least five castles, but there was only enough room in their funds for just one. That problem was rectified by simply filming the garrison available to them using different camera angles. However, my favorite behind-the-scenes anecdote involves horses; because they couldn't afford any, the ""riders"" merely skipped along and emulated the clippety-clop sound of equine hooves by banging two coconuts together. 🤣Satirizing Arthurian legend, the movie takes place in 932 England ~pre Norman conquest~ where Arthur, King of the Britons, and his servant Patsy ""gallop"" the moorish countryside. The Pythons waste no time getting to the side-splitting hilarity as Arthur stops at castle #1 and asks the gatekeeper up above if anyone there wishes to join him in his court of Camelot. What begins as a recruiting inquiry escalates into a fluctuating discussion about coconuts within a temperate zone and the migratory patterns of unladen swallows, whether they be European or African.Moving on, Arthur, approaching castle #2, inquires about its occupancy to a peasant named Dennis(!), where it soon devolves into a very funny discourse ~with Marxist overtones~ over ""outdated imperialist dogma"" nine centuries before Communist Manifesto was even published. Okay....no knights of Camelot to be enlisted here!! The most fondly remembered scene in the movie quickly ensues as Arthur reluctantly engages in a sword fight with the Black Knight (""Tis but a scratch).In time King Arthur assembles his court of Camelot (a silly place!), starting with Sir Belvedere, followed by Sir Galahad, Sir Lancelot, Sir Robin, and assorted squires and minstrels. Oh.... I forgot to mention Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.😄 One day God himself appears from the heavens and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail. Castle #3 beckons as Arthur unsuccessfully attempts to barter with its French occupants ~more than a century before the Norman conquest.Realizing that they may have a better chance of locating the Grail separately Arthur and his fellowship ~I mean, his knights~ temporarily split up in the hopes of regrouping at a later date. The not-so-brave Robin has the least success, showing his true colors by chickening out of confrontations. Meanwhile, an exhausted Galahad collapses at the doorstep of castle #4, drawn there by the grail shaped beacon lit high above. He is tended to by more than two dozen virginal young women who haven't seen a man in ages and are desperately wanting to be deflowered. Sadly, Galahad is ""saved"" by Lancelot, who drags him away from the peril despite repeated pleas from Galahad to let him stay behind and ""face the peril"".🤣As for Lancelot, he has his own (mis)adventure when, assuming he's rescuing a fair lass being forced to marry against her will, storms into the grounds of castle #5 and slaughters more than half of the wedding guests. It turns out the lass in question is actually the effeminate son of a wealthy landowner using the marriage as an opportunity to acquire more land. Meantime, in Scene 24 ~a ""smashing scene with some lovely acting""~ Arthur and Belvedere receive cryptic clues about the Grail's location from a mysterious old man, and soon come face to face with the dreaded Knights Who Say Ni.Directed by the two Terrys, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is an unconventionally disjointed comedy that goes off in all sorts of loopy directions. But this is not a critique because that was exactly how the Flying Circus was constructed, with Terry Gilliam's delightfully crude animation linking everything together. The movie's opening credits alone are a blueprint for the silliness to come, with fake Swedish subtitles and endless references to moose. (ie. Miss Taylor's moose by....)😂 Even Richard Nixon gets a nod.Neil Innes, the unofficial ""seventh Python"", proves himself invaluable to them in the music department. A musical satirist, Innes joined the Flying Circus for their final season and contributed to their comedy albums. On THE HOLY GRAIL, in addition to appearing on-screen as one of Robin's minstrels, Innes delivers a pretty good score, one that's compatible with a medieval motion picture, not to mention a pair of interesting parody songs about the knights of the Round Table and the (not so) brave, brave Sir Robin.Special kudos must also be reserved to the Pythons for their remarkably accurate visual interpretation of the Middle Ages. Many past movies set in feudalism England always portrayed it with a certain pageantry featuring the type of costumes and set designs that usually received Oscar nominations. The well read Pythons countered that myth by showing the mud, blood, and complete lack of glamor. The seemingly never-ending cold Scottish precipitation made filming physically uncomfortable, but, in the end, it contributed enormously to THE HOLY GRAIL's medieval composition.Released to mixed reviews in 1975, the ensuing decades have been very kind to MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, where it is now justifiably regarded as one of the funniest movies ever made, as surely as the Flying Circus was to television. The Pythons proved to be highly influential on every subsequent laughfest in its wacky wake. Let's face it; without them, there would have been no Saturday Night Live, no South Park, and no Simpsons. When it came to defining comedy, Monty Python's gift seemed almost sent from heaven. 🔚",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9508658/?ref_=tt_urv

Hauru No Ugoku Shiro,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0347149,"Really good movie, just one complaint","Sometimes, the more ""comic"" characters would be present in dramatic or emotional scenes, so I wasn't fully immersed in them as I kept expecting one of those characters to speak up and make a joke at the wrong time. It is a shame too, since Studio Ghibli films usually have pretty good emotional scenes. Well, apart from the ridiculously copious amount of tears that characters shed whenever they cry, of course. But otherwise, I really liked the animation (as par for the course with Studio Ghibli films), the backgrounds, and the structuring of the scenes centring around the war attacks. I do wish that aspect of the movie could have been a bit more elaborated on, and the ending felt a bit too idyllic, but oh well.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9513244/?ref_=tt_urv

Inside Out,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2096673,The last great Pixar movie,"Confession time: I didn't like Coco very much.Inside Out was the last Pixar film I truly loved, the last which still feel having the same creative spark which inspired family classics such as Ratatouille and Up. (Coincidentally, this was co-directed by Pete Docter, who previously worked in the aftermentioned movie along with Bob Peterson)In the same vein of the best Pixar movies, clever humor is perfectly well combined with genuine heartfelt moments, sincere and relatable for any casual viewer.Modern Pixar has lost that earnest quality, in my opinion. Some of their movies are still entertaining, and have many positive qualities, but something feels different about them nowadays. Almost as if something was missing.Hope the announced sequel have at least a half of the charm the first movie had. Still, is a bit sad to see modern Pixar so focused in sequels.8.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530951/?ref_=tt_urv
