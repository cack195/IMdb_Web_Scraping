1,19. Se7en,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114369,Riveting despite the plot holes,"Fincher's mastery of mise en scene is probably never better than here in Se7en. Like Virgil, Fincher guides us through Hell, but Hell on Earth, designed around a serial killer using the Biblical seven deadly sins as his motive. The scenes of death (always post crime) are meticulously filmed and edited to ensure we are never mere observers but at one with the ongoing investigation and as we spiral down deeper into the abyss the world around us becomes more terrifying, none more so than that of the prostitute killing. Interspersed is a brilliant chase scene during a rainstorm where even the weather seems to be weaponised.Morgan Freeman is simply peerless and doesn't put a foot wrong. Brad Pitt, for me, struggles with his delivery at times, almost overacting to try and make the point but his physicality and screen presence is comparable with Steve McQueen at his finest and brilliantly handles his wordless part in the demoument, the despair of wanting revenge and trying to resist, riddled in his eyes.Spacey appears only briefly, but his character, like Harry Lime in The Third Man, kept in the background, haunts subsequent viewings.My one problem is with the demouement and I'm sure it will be contentious with Se7en fans.The power of what John Doe does is his belief that he is wreaking vengeance on those that deserve it - cue his valedictory in the car en route to the final scene, where he espouses the righteousness of his actions. How, one might ask, does his final killing of Tracy fit that scenario? She is simply a pregnant wife scared for the future of her baby being born into such a cruel world. John Doe, knowing this, despatches an innocent victim in a despicable manner and contrary to the design of his previous murders. We discover that this is designed to provoke Mills, who has shown his penchant for losing his temper, to despatch John Doe and complete the deadly sin cycle of Covetousness (John Doe) and Wrath (Mills) but in doing so this consigns John Doe's actions to that of yet another serial killer and diminishes the power of the original premise.I believe the script acknowledges the problematic, introducing the dialogue from John Doe's telephone converstion with Mills after his apartment is discovered, where John Doe informs the detectives he will have to alter his plans, insinuating that there were different envy/wrath punishments in the offing. What these were we are never told but we presume the ultimate outcome of these would still have been the self-sacrifice of John Doe at the end and with the best will in the world I can't see how he would've achieved that.It's a small criticism of a film that, more than many at the end of the nineties, encapsultes the violence of the 20th century and prophesizes the fears of the 21st.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537204/?ref_=tt_urv
2,27. The Green Mile,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0120689,A movie that you will never forget,"I love The Green Mile for a multitude of reasons. First it is a three hour movie that never gets boring, second it has great writing that is comparable to The Dark Knight, and third the characters are lovable and you actually care about them. The acting from both Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan was excellent and you could tell that they actually wanted this movie to succeed. It is a very somber film that you will remember for years. I think this is one of the rare moments when the movie was better than the source material. I hope that years later this movie will be remembered as one of the best movies ever made.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536750/?ref_=tt_urv
3,32. Spirited Away,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0245429,A beautiful story with lovable characters,"I would argue that Spirited Away is my favourite Studio Ghibli film. A friend of mine introduced me to Ghibli through this movie when I was a kid and I cannot give higher praise.We follow the main character, Chihiro, a seemingly immature and needy child who finds herself in the world of kami. The plot revolves around her finding a way to free herself and her parents from this world and the witch Yubaba. The beauty of this protagonist is how much she changes from her experience in kami and the lessons she learns from the characters she meets along the way.Each character we meet has separate personalities and goals, and they each help Chihiro in one way or another, whether that is actively helping her and being a friend, or being an adversary. All of the characters are grey, with no real black or white, making characters more realistic and applicable to real life.The visual experience alone is gorgeous, the animation is flawless and captivating. The music is relaxing and captures the essence of the story.This film is excellent and I seriously suggest watching it in the original Japanese with subtitles. This is one Ghibli film that is much better in Japanese than the English dub.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539507/?ref_=tt_urv

5,42. The Prestige,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0482571,The ending falls flat,"This movie is a fantastic presentation of sacrifice in rivalries and losing everything over an obsession, the question of 'How?' leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout, and while that curiosity was answered, it led into a strange sci-fi turn that I think destroys the whole premise of magicians being an 'illusion' and, as shown throughout the movie, people knowing that its a con, but wanting to believe as a source of wonder and amazement. The twist and revelation of Christian Bale's character was unexpected and teased unknowingly throughout the film and while the 'twin' reveal may be a little cliche I think it was done amazingly and really showed how something so simple can torment. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman's twist was, as I mentioned earlier, drifting into the supernatural and, funnily enough, I had a prediction that was almost exact to the twist but thought it unbelievable and a poor plot so it was discarded.Overall, 'The Prestige' is definitely worth watching but It does leave you feeling a little unsatisfied afterwards.The acting is amazing - as is the cast, and living the suspense with both characters instead of dramatic irony is really quite unique and exhilarating.7.5/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530923/?ref_=tt_urv

7,45. The Usual Suspects,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114814,The masterclass in storytelling-an intricately woven crime thriller,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a masterclass in storytelling-an intricately woven crime thriller that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats until its breathtaking conclusion. Directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie, this film is a gripping exploration of deception, manipulation, and the elusive nature of truth.The narrative centers around a police interrogation of the sole survivor of a massacre and a heist gone wrong, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). As Kint recounts the events leading up to the tragedy, a web of intrigue unfolds, involving a group of criminals with shadowy connections to the enigmatic crime lord Keyser Söze.What sets ""The Usual Suspects"" apart is its non-linear storytelling and unreliable narrator, which keeps viewers guessing until the final revelatory moments. McQuarrie's sharp script and Singer's deft direction create an atmosphere of tension and suspense, crafting a narrative puzzle that challenges audiences to piece together the truth.The film is propelled by a stellar ensemble cast, with standout performances from Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, and Kevin Pollak. Spacey's portrayal of Verbal Kint is particularly memorable, exuding a cunning charm that keeps the audience second-guessing his motives until the shocking climax.""The Usual Suspects"" is renowned for its twist ending-one that subverts expectations and reshapes the entire narrative. This unexpected conclusion, coupled with the film's intricate plot and character dynamics, invites multiple viewings to uncover the layers of deception woven into the story.The film's legacy as a gripping and cleverly crafted crime thriller endures, earning its place as a cult classic in the genre. Its impact lies in its ability to keep audiences engaged, questioning the nature of truth and the depths of deception, long after the credits roll.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534475/?ref_=tt_urv
8,50. Rear Window,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0047396,Brilliant,"Donald Spoto's biography of Hitchcock was titled, ""The Dark Side of Genius."" A biography of Cornell Woolrich could merit the same title and ""Rear Window"" is the perfect marriage of two purely unique and supremely talented artists. Hitchcock's pictorial compositions, staging and editing were never better than here, where most of the action is confined to the room where the hero is recuperating from an accident. James Stewart talent for conveying anxiety and nervousness underscores the suspense as his lovely fiancee, Grace Kelly, attempts to help him solve a murder perpetrated by a demented neighbor, Raymond Burr. The Hitchcock/Woolrich theme of perverse evil in the midst of amiable normalcy has never been more vividly and elegantly illustrated.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9519129/?ref_=tt_urv
9,54. Apocalypse Now,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0078788,Colossal,"A colossal masterpiece... The story is fabulous, a mental dive into the jungle and madness. Everything in the mise-en-scene contributes to making it an experience of immense depth: the editing which plays with superpositions and reminiscences, Willard's introspective voice-over which structures the entire film, Carmine Coppola's haunting electronic score...You shouldn't expect a real war film, except perhaps in its first part where we find Colonel Kilgore, the helicopters, Wagner, the explosions and all, but the film quickly becomes something else, a physical and mental odyssey connected to the psyche of Colonel Kurtz, an ambiguous and fascinating character embodied in an incredible and instinctive way by Marlon Brando and his improvised monologues.I rather recommend the original edit, because the scenes added in the Redux and Final Cut versions are a bit weaker and tend to dilute the impact of the film.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9500414/?ref_=tt_urv
10,56. Memento,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0209144,Overrated and pretentious,"I actually understand why the movie is shown in the nature it is, and thought that was an interesting choice in keeping the audience also in the dark, like the character was. Bravo for that, even if it's annoying to the viewer.The problem is that the film is completely one of those pretentious 'ambiguous' believe what you want to movies. You watch in this annoying format hoping to get concrete answers, but never do. The ending, or beginning, depending on how you see it, is completely up to you to figure out. Directors think they are being artistic, but they're being annoying.So yeah, don't bother unless you like to write your own story I guess.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9527207/?ref_=tt_urv
11,59. Das Leben der Anderen,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0405094,Likely worth a watch and your time!,"I really like the subject matter and how they portrayed this time period with how they showed how information on betrayal to one's allegiance would get reported/investigated/and gathered. It makes you think how it's different now since there is a lot more technology and mediums involved with this kind of spying even in so called ""democracies"" and ""free"" societies, and the acting on top of all of that was good as well. It kind of slowed down in the middle of the film a bit but by the end it wrapped itself up very nicely and it was good closure with how the story and arcs were handled. The closing lines and moments at the very end were perfect! Quite powerful.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9518797/?ref_=tt_urv
12,65. Witness for the Prosecution,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0051201,Clever and remarkably entertaining courtroom drama,"This clever and remarkably entertaining courtroom drama is quite possible the best big-screen adaptation of any Agatha Christie story. The film stars an obesely overweight and delightfully arrogant Charles Laughton as an expert defence barrister who takes on a seemingly impossible case of defending a good-natured American man (Tyrone Power) in a murder case full of circumstantial evidence - including the statement of his wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), which may or may not implicate him. Fans of crackerjack writing will be treated to plenty of intellectual banter and delightful twists, right up until the very end. Crisp black-and-white cinematography by Russell Harlan and skilful narrative pacing courtesy of veteran director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard) make the movie a feast for eyes and mind despite a very limited number of locations. Laughton is superb as the lethargic and acerbic but very much principled Sir Wilfrid. This was Tyrone Power's last fully completed film before his sudden death in Madrid a year after its release.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9508284/?ref_=tt_urv
13,73. Oldeuboi,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0364569,worth watching and thinking,"Frankly speaking, it's a great film, even though the storyline seems absurd, shocking, and against the common social morality. Never gossip others' personal life as long as it wouldn't interfere with our own interests. People should learn to respect and tolerate with each other's social behavior as long as it wouldn't physically hurt anyone and do real harm to the stability of our society. At the very least, if you don't agree with other people's ""bizarre"" but non-harmful behavior, you can simply choose not to socialize with them and let them be. People should never ever publicly expose others' privacy, let alone insulting those who are different from us. Anyway, I think we all can learn a thing or two from this movie, even though most of us might feel extremely uncomfortable with these shocking scenes.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540509/?ref_=tt_urv

Since early already is shown to the public how his family hates music, and also tells about the history of his grandpa and how asshole he was (as far as it had been shown). Beyond the whole history delevoped in the movie, also is shown indirectly the culture of Mexico and how the people lead with the death, what is in my opinion really beatifull. The art of this movie is fantastic, and the work well done with the soudtrack is unbelievable. I'm even now with the songs in my head, ""Remember me"", for example, depicts perfectly the relation of the protagonist with his grandma and what he feels about her.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9490136/?ref_=tt_urv

THRILLER/ DRAMAAdapted from the novel by Edo Makubein associate produced, co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, directing a ""Ransom-like"" scenario where the father's son gets kidnapped, this adds a whole new spin to that kind of genre where it's not the father's son that gets captured but the chauffeur's son. And there's a little cat and mouse where it's always fascinating how the police work together to capture this perpetrator. The only problem with the overall film is that the film feels a little out dated but does an extremely good job about debating it's complicated situations regarding the ransom. The fifteenth of sixteen movies Kurosawa collaborated with Toshiro Mifune.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9410777/?ref_=tt_urv

A work of German expressionism, the film is a work that has been able to transcend time.Peter Lorre's great acting , a beautiful thriller-crime film has emerged with the genius of the director.Period 1. He came out of the world war II with a heavy defeat and 2. It was shot in a country where fascism is rising, where the world war is being felt.The main crucial event of the film is hidden at the end. The fact that the director leaves the question of who is to blame to you, the pressure of society , everything remains on your conscience.I won't strongly recommend watching it, but watching the social structure of the period, the first examples of film noir, although unknown, and the genius who directed a film like persopolis is a good experience to explore. 8/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9479065/?ref_=tt_urv
18,102. North by Northwest,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0053125,North by Northwest,"""Thornhill"" (Cary Grant) is your typically fast-talking advertising executive who is meeting some folks for a drink when he is mistaken for a ""Mr. Caplan"". Whisked off at gunpoint to meet ""Vandamm"" (James Mason) and his henchman ""Leonard"" (Martin Landau) his protestations of innocence just get him pumped full of booze and put behind the wheel of a car, the likely suspect of a murder investigation. He has to stay one step ahead of the pursuing police now as he tries to get his life back, a task made more difficult by his encounter with the charmingly enigmatic ""Eve"" (a rather static Eva Marie Saint) whom he is not entirely sure he can trust. What Hitchcock delivers now is a slowly unravelling adventure mystery with loads of red herrings, plenty of well written and executed humour from Grant and a gradually accruing sense of menace as we finally realise just what is going on. The photography is intimate one moment, all-encompassing the next, the crop dusting scene is the stuff of cinema legend and I challenge any non-American to name the fourth bloke atop Mount Rushmore at the end. To be fair, that denouement wasn't my favourite - it's a bit rushed and rather convenient, but this is still a stylishly produced thriller, with an exciting score from Bernard Herrmann that still stands the test of time.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9524822/?ref_=tt_urv
19,103. Vertigo,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0052357,"Groundbreaking themes, visuals in this moody classic thriller","I recently watched the restored version of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" The plot, which has some puzzling holes, follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) as a retired San Francisco police detective who grapples with crippling acrophobia, vertigo and guilt after a rooftop chase of a suspect results in a fellow cop's death. Scottie spends time with his ex-fiancee and best buddy, Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes in a very underrated performance), an independent, successful commercial artist who still pines for him.With little to do with his time, Scottie takes on a private eye gig to follow the gorgeous young wife of a wealthy college chum, Gavin Elster, who has suspicions about what she's doing all day long. It appears that the young, glamorous Madeleine (Kim Novak) is obsessed with her dead great-grandmother, Carlotta, who committed suicide and became an old San Francisco legend. Scottie follows Madeleine as she visits Carlotta's grave at a picturesque Spanish mission churchyard and her portrait in the museum. Naturally, Scottie falls madly in love with the ethereal, elegant and haunted Madeleine, and becomes obsessed with her, with disastrous results all around.""Vertigo"" explores mental illness, obsession and the dark, destructive side of sexual attraction. Scottie's phobias (fear of heights and fear of falling) and his vertigo are major plot elements, crippling him emotionally and cutting his career short -- in effect, emasculating him. He seems energized by his passion for Madeleine, but it actually clouds his judgment and causes him more pain.The elements that stood out for me were stylistic, especially Hitchcock's very deliberate manipulation of light and color. When Midge and Scottie visit a bookstore to ask the owner, a local historian, what he knows about Madeleine's ancestor, the lighting gradually darkens to the point where you can hardly see the three actors, then brightens again once they step outside, although at dusk. There is a famous shot of Kim Novak walking out of a hotel bathroom, perfectly dressed and coiffed, where she is bathed in eerie green light from the neon sign outside. The camera is placed from Scottie's viewpoint, and we sense that he has given himself over to his obsession and idealization of this woman. There is a wild, colorful, animated dream sequence which seems dated now, but at the time, would have been rather avant-garde.Hitchcock also made the most of the spectacular settings of 1950s San Francisco, with many of its striking landmarks (Coit Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Muir Woods, the Palace of the Legion of Honor) as sites for important plot twists. In a film about obsession, detachment from reality and dreams, San Francisco seems like a film set dreamed up by an artist, but of course, all these places are real.The plot has some serious holes, including the characters' motivations. You would have to overlook that and simply enjoy the languid beauty of the cinematography, and the exploration of obsession and other psychological themes.Also, Stewart's age was an issue for me in this role. Stewart looks too old to be a romantic partner for Novak in this film, although I thought they made a cute, quirky couple in the comedy ""Bell, Book and Candle,"" where he was a publishing executive -- more of a worldly, attractive figure than a San Fran cop who had to take early retirement because of his fear of heights and can't even buy you drinks at the Top of the Mark. He looks old enough to be retired from the police force because, well, he was at retirement age for a cop. He and Midge talk about how they had dated in college, but Midge looks much younger than him. In fact, Bel Geddes was 14 years younger than Stewart.The films of that era often paired young actresses with established male actors old enough to be their fathers, and it doesn't always resonate with modern audiences in my opinion. In some films, it makes more sense that the ""ingenue"" would fall for a powerful, wealthy and sophisticated older man, but in other films, it just feels a bit creepy. It works better if the script actually acknowledges the age difference.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9527703/?ref_=tt_urv
20,104. Double Indemnity,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0036775,Double Indemnity is Outstanding Film Noir,"The chemistry and charisma of Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray smolder and ignite in this classic film noir about a murder for insurance money scheme gone wrong. Expertly filmed and fast-paced, Double Indemnity draws the audience into the swirl of passion, fantasies of riches, and evil plans that unravel faster than the heated passion it took to cook them up in the first place.Barbara Stanwyck brings just the right combination of looks, smarts and emotional manipulation to the role as the wife who wants her husband dead. The audience sees insurance agent/Stanwyck stooge Fred MacMurray's detached and cynical facade shift as he turns into a calculating plotter of murder, followed by his helpless entrapment as the walls close in by unexpected circumstances as the insurance scheme unravels.In his role as MacMurray's boss, Edward G. Robinson's cunning realization that the supposed accident staged for a huge insurance payout was a fraud all along adds a fiery and intellectual topping to this movie.Expertly and intricately plotted, and yet presented in a logical, coherent way the audience can follow, this film is a must see for any fan of Billy Wilder productions and the art and drama of cinema.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536297/?ref_=tt_urv
