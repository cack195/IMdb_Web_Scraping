1,24. Saving Private Ryan,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0120815,FUBAR,"I went into this movie knowing it's good and praised. It was still an amazing watch. One of finest collaboration between Mr. Hanks and Mr. Spielberg, *Saving Private Ryan,* still maintains its glorious status after many years. Its opening scene in Omaha Beach is probably the best war battle sequence of all time and its influence is ubiquitous in many war movies to come afterward. Its depiction of war is not sensationalized and it's almost too realistic. The fear that these soldiers felt can be felt through the screen as well. The next major battle sequence at the bridge was quite amazing too but the first opening scene was quite overwhelming.The story in between the battles is still interesting. The major theme around this movie concerns the morality of forming a search party for one man. To save private Ryan, many lives have been sacrificed. Lives lost vs lives saved is a key theme and just like the members of the search party, the audience can't help but question the morality of it all. It's a flawed mission from the start but also is justified by the unimaginable potential grief of losing all four sons to war. Other aspects of the story of how Captain Miller is a hardened but still anxious English teacher turned into leader on the war field. The story of Upham and his idea of morality during wartime is also something to ponder about. This movie is great because it doesn't depict these guys as heroes and most of them die anyways. They are just regular people caught in fires of war.Watching fine and well-crafted movies like this should all bring anti-war sentiments. There is nothing glorious about war. Although the movie starts and ends with the American flag, it is seen as a nod of respect for those who have perished in war rather than calling for more people on the battlefield. If the latter was the purpose, the Omaha beach scene would have been more glamorized. Chilling movie.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9531203/?ref_=tt_urv
2,26. Life Is Beautiful,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0118799,The poignant and heart-wrenching film,"""Life Is Beautiful"" is a poignant and heart-wrenching film that navigates the resilience of the human spirit amidst the darkest of circumstances. Directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, this masterpiece effortlessly blends humor, love, and tragedy against the backdrop of World War II.The story revolves around Guido, a charming and optimistic Jewish man, who uses his wit and humor to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration camp. With unwavering determination, Guido turns their internment into a game, creating an elaborate ruse to protect his son and shield him from the brutal realities of their situation.What sets ""Life Is Beautiful"" apart is its ability to find light in the midst of darkness, using humor and love as a form of resistance against the cruelty of war. Benigni's portrayal of Guido is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, encapsulating the strength of a father's love and the human capacity to find hope in the bleakest of circumstances.The film's tonal shifts from lightheartedness to poignancy are masterfully executed, evoking laughter and tears in equal measure. It delicately balances the innocence of childhood with the harsh realities of wartime atrocities, leaving a profound emotional impact on its audience.""Life Is Beautiful"" is a testament to the power of the human spirit to triumph over adversity. It doesn't shy away from the horrors of the Holocaust but instead focuses on the enduring power of love and the importance of preserving innocence in the face of unimaginable darkness.The film's emotional resonance and universal themes of love, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit have earned it critical acclaim and numerous awards, including three Academy Awards. Its legacy endures as a timeless reminder of the enduring power of hope and the beauty found within life's most challenging moments.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534481/?ref_=tt_urv
3,33. The Pianist,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0253474,Haunting WWII film.,"Revisiting this film I found it really holds up very well. The film opens with invasion and the coming occupation of Warsaw, a family must now decide whether to flee, and if so where to go? Our main character is a middle-class musician, cultured, well dressed, handsome but his world is now turned up side down. The early scenes of the city apartments being emptied, of glass smashing, radio falling silent and distress are all really well directed and acted. We next move now to the Warsaw ghetto and the casual brutality and contempt the occupiers now display to the inhabitants. Our main character is still able to work as a pianist but his life now is looking increasingly precarious. The family fortune dwindles, money has little value anymore. You really have to give high praise to the costumes, props and locations, I really felt myself there living it. This is an English language film but you don't really hear any English accents which at least helps. It has a bit of a desaturated look but it's still very much something shot on film and not at all like some digital films we get now. The story is very much that of the pianist, everything that happens we see through his eyes. The thuggery and terror brought by the Nazis is revolting and shocking. There's a tiny bit of CGI but mostly it's all in camera and I have to give the production values very high praise. At times I did slightly loose track of what year it was, maybe that's deliberate. I also found our main character very passive, there's no mad heroics, no impassioned speeches from him, he's probably too shocked for anything remotely like that. As I said it's very much his story, we have no sense of who's winning or losing the war, no cut aways to generals looking at maps or giving out orders really. There's some great physical acting in here too, our main character's appearance change so much as he lives a more and more hunted and animal like life. He is truly just a survivor in an increasingly dangerous landscape. We see some acts of defiance and resistance, his life though is terribly lonely and he carries with him his love of music throughout his life on the run.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522421/?ref_=tt_urv
4,43. Grave of the Fireflies,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0095327,Beautiful fireflies,"What an amazing movie!!!!It was so beautiful and so emotional. I could not stop myself crying. Watched many animation movie, only few of them will give you this kind of emotions. I will remember this movie for many years for sure.First I hesitate to watch this movie because it's an old movie, I thought the animation won't be good. But I want try it Because of the hype. I'm glad I tried this and it deserves the hype.And everything so good In whole movie. I don't think I can move From this movie, It will haunt me for a week.. now I need to watch another light hearted movie to overcome this emotion.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9495604/?ref_=tt_urv
5,46. Casablanca,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0034583,10/10,"To get it out of the way, I couldn't choose between whether this film was a 9.75 or 10. This is due to the ending not being what I wanted, but I am giving it a 10 because overall, the ending definitely was amazing. Either way, I am not going to argue with people who consider this a masterpiece or as their favorite film, because this film definitely is a masterpiece. Though I do wish Rick and Ilsa had their happy ending with each other, this does remind me that one of the most important things about loves is that the woman is as safe as possible in any situation or circumstance. I have to probably place this in my top 5 favorite films of all time, along with Singin in the Rain, City Lights, It's a Wonderful Life, and Titanic.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9523536/?ref_=tt_urv
6,54. Apocalypse Now,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0078788,Colossal,"A colossal masterpiece... The story is fabulous, a mental dive into the jungle and madness. Everything in the mise-en-scene contributes to making it an experience of immense depth: the editing which plays with superpositions and reminiscences, Willard's introspective voice-over which structures the entire film, Carmine Coppola's haunting electronic score...You shouldn't expect a real war film, except perhaps in its first part where we find Colonel Kilgore, the helicopters, Wagner, the explosions and all, but the film quickly becomes something else, a physical and mental odyssey connected to the psyche of Colonel Kurtz, an ambiguous and fascinating character embodied in an incredible and instinctive way by Marlon Brando and his improvised monologues.I rather recommend the original edit, because the scenes added in the Redux and Final Cut versions are a bit weaker and tend to dilute the impact of the film.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9500414/?ref_=tt_urv
7,61. Paths of Glory,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0050825,Making a Mountain out of an Ant Hill,"Although this film is primarily seen as a war film, it may find more in common with a courtroom drama. It is 1916 in France in the heart of a battle in World War I. General Mireau wants to capture part of the battlefield known as ""The Ant Hill"". He tells Col. Dax to capture the Ant Hill. The general figures that he will only lose roughly...65% of his men in the venture. As the men go to capture this hill, they find the task impossible and can't progress passed the first trench. This displeases General Mireau and he wants to charge them for cowardice.The villain can be a tad too over the top. He makes the mayor from ""Jaws"" look subtle. It weakens the theme because of how extreme he is.Unlike so many other Stanley Kubrick films, this one is very straight forward. It is a tight 88-minute runtime. It follows a simple 3 act structure with a clear protagonist and antagonist. It is decisively un- pretentious, but that isn't to imply that the movie has nothing to say. It is a poignant and engaging tale and should be seen.It deserves all the glory it gets.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9527105/?ref_=tt_urv
8,66. The Great Dictator,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0032553,Biting satire on Fascist Europe.,"A great film from Chaplin. While still employing a little slapstick this is still a much modern film in some ways. A fair bit of the comedy comes from the dialogue which is very sharp and funny at times. The film continually mocks the Nazis as both mindless thugs committed to a ridiculous ideology which is right for ridicule. Paulette Goddard is wonderful in this movie and conveys so well the warmth and goodness so missing in many of her fellow humans. The production history of this film was quite interesting, I think the film is not without it's flaws, the way in which Chaplin feels the need to literally tell the audience everything that is right and wrong when until that point the film had done a better job at showing us. The scene of the globe has become especially iconic.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9522105/?ref_=tt_urv
9,69. Inglourious Basterds,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0361748,Tarantino's best?,"The above headline is always, indeed, a rather difficult choice. Tarantino is definitely one of my, if not the most, favourite of my directors, and for good reasons. Having provided so many unique, thought provoking and overall fun and splendidly put together dramas of all sorts in his own unique flair.This ever acclaimed war drama of his is, however, perhaps the best out of them all. It is a very profound, satirical and beautifully put together piece - with wonderful performances, not the least by Christoph Waltz, among all others. Splendid writing, splendid performances, and overall very beautifully put together in terms of cinematography, cutting and editing.Overall, definitely a great, unconventional and masterful achievement. Highly recommended as ever!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9530159/?ref_=tt_urv
10,72. Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0057012,Genuine satire,"The great Stanley Kubrick was a surprisingly versatile director - during his brilliant career, he tried many genres and directions in cinema. The legendary film ""Doctor Strangelove"" is not only one of the most amazing comedies in the history of cinema, but also a very subtle and intelligent political satire, uncompromisingly ridiculing the entire political insanity of the ruling elite of the ""two nuclear superpowers.""In this film, Kubrick boldly addresses almost all pressing political issues. We are witnessing a real circus of freaks, in which the main clowns are: generals, politicians, ambassadors and, finally, leaders of governments. The plot of the film subsequently twists in such a dizzying spiral that one is left amazed at the skill of the great author, who managed to maintain style and taste without slipping into cheap shock value scenes. Stanley Kubrick brilliantly deconstructs the many archetypes of the Cold War. It is deconstructed in a very unbiased way. Each of the characters in the picture represents something. Kubrick seems to encrypt entertaining ideological agendas in his characters, delivering a harsh verdict on each of the opposing political systems.Truly one of the best political satires of the 20th century.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521006/?ref_=tt_urv
11,77. Das Boot,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0082096,Tense WWII film,"A really impressive and superbly directed film. The cinematography and art direction is so impressive, I've never seen such a convincingly well done film of a submarine. The film also has great sound design, you feel the loneliness of the Atlantic ocean, the danger of the hunter suddenly becoming the hunted, the great details like the men also becoming more dishevelled and bearded over the course of the story. The effects are quite well done and some of it is extremely tense, the acting is all really excellent, war is shown as being cruel and brutal, utterly merciless. I watched the film in the original German with subtitles. One of the best war movies I think made.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9513562/?ref_=tt_urv
12,78. Braveheart,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0112573,It's a Subjective Thing,"The Academy loves awarding splashy historical flicks with good stories about people living for ideals with Best Pucture Oscars. ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart.""Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on.""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace.The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy.Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9531241/?ref_=tt_urv
13,90. Idi I Smotri,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0091251,A stunning and eerie cinematic experience.,"The film's strength is its ability to portray the emotional and psychological toll that war has on its protagonists. The breakdown of innocence and the severe psychological effects of violence are expertly captured by Klimov. An immersive experience that makes the audience feel the weight of the characters' experiences is created by the use of long takes and dramatic, almost documentary-like cinematography. These are excellent performances, especially Kravchenko's. Florya's development from an innocent and idealistic youngster to a shell-shocked observer of unspeakable horrors is portrayed by the young actor with compelling effect. The vast variety of characters impacted by the war is portrayed by the supporting cast, which further enhances the film's authenticity. The film's sound design is also noteworthy; Oleg Yanchenko's eerie and moving score nicely contrasts with the austere images. The film's immersive atmosphere is enhanced, and each scene's emotional effect is amplified by the sounds of battle, ranging from distant explosions to the frightening cries of troops. It is difficult to watch Come and See (a warning) because it shows the severity of war without sugarcoating or romanticizing its atrocities. A realistic depiction of the catastrophic impact of conflict on both persons and communities is produced by Klimov's directing decisions and the film's relentless narrative. The brilliantly made and very moving movie serves as a sobering reminder of the human cost of war. Some viewers may find its uncompromising style difficult to handle, but for those prepared to face the brutal facts of history, this film offers a profoundly moving and provocative cinematic experience.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9506523/?ref_=tt_urv
14,98. Lawrence of Arabia,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0056172,Sensational,"The music and picture quality in this epic are both outstanding, truly excellent, practically every actor was perfectly cast in their roles maybe with the exception of Alex Guinness, I'd have preferred an Arab actor there. The sets and locations looked authentic and real, the scope of the film was immense. The film was shot in location in Jordan I believe and follows the true story of a British officer who helped leads to Arabs to revolt against the Turks during WWI, fighting with guerrilla tactics. The film also explores the darker side of war, what it can do to an ordinary person's mind. The film is also not afraid to touch upon the imperial ambitions of the British leadership and how their version of the of the Middle East after WWI looks a little different the one Lawrence expects. The film's cinematography is extraordinary and the scope of the story is breath-taking. This is not just a great war movie or biopic but is now widely considered one of the greatest movies every made.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9515489/?ref_=tt_urv
15,107. Full Metal Jacket,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0093058,Best movie ever!,"""Full Metal Jacket,"" stands as a cinematic triumph that skillfully navigates the grim realities of war with both raw intensity and profound insight. The film, divided into two compelling acts, seamlessly weaves together a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is visually arresting.The first half of the movie is a tour de force in itself, immersing viewers in the relentless crucible of Marine Corps boot camp. R. Lee Ermey's portrayal of the unyielding drill instructor is nothing short of iconic, delivering a performance that is both terrifying and captivating. Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail in depicting the rigorous training process not only adds authenticity but also sets the stage for the emotional journey that follows.As the narrative transitions to the harsh landscapes of the Vietnam War, ""Full Metal Jacket"" continues to excel in its portrayal of the psychological toll of combat. The film follows Private Joker, portrayed with nuance by Matthew Modine, as he evolves from a wide-eyed recruit to a war correspondent. The transformation of the characters serves as a poignant commentary on the dehumanizing effects of war, prompting reflection on the profound impact it has on those who experience it.Kubrick's masterful direction is evident throughout, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke a range of emotions. The cinematography captures the brutality of war with unflinching precision, while the juxtaposition of dark humor against the backdrop of chaos adds layers of complexity to the storytelling. The result is a film that is as visually arresting as it is thematically rich.Furthermore, the soundtrack, featuring a mix of iconic tracks, complements the film's atmosphere, enhancing the emotional resonance of key moments. The carefully curated music contributes to the immersive experience, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a cinematic tour de force that not only stands as a testament to Stanley Kubrick's directorial prowess but also as a poignant exploration of the human psyche in the face of the brutality of war. With its stellar performances, striking visuals, and thematic depth, the film remains a powerful and enduring work of art that continues to resonate with audiences, cementing its place as a classic in the war film genre.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9476416/?ref_=tt_urv
16,108. Incendies,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1255953,A Riveting Journey into the Heart of Identity,"As a cinephile in search of narratives that resonate, ""incendies"" stands as a mesmerizing gem that left an indelible mark on my cinematic journey. Denis Villeneuve's masterful storytelling, coupled with powerful performances, elevates this film to a rarefied realm.From the outset, the enigmatic equation ""1+1=1"" becomes a haunting refrain, weaving through a narrative that unfolds with meticulous precision. The film's emotional depth is staggering, as it peels back layers of identity and history, revealing a tapestry of human connections that transcend time and borders.The performances, especially by Lubna Azabal and Mélissa Désormeaux-poulin, are nothing short of captivating. Their portrayals add visceral intensity to a storyline that navigates the complexities of love, loss, and the enduring ties that bind us.Villeneuve's deft direction creates an immersive experience, drawing me into the visceral landscapes of conflict and resilience. The cinematography, coupled with a haunting score, enhances the film's atmospheric weight, making each frame resonate long after the credits roll.While ""incendies"" demands emotional investment, the payoff is profound-a visceral and thought-provoking exploration of human interconnectedness. This film isn't just watched; it's felt, etching its narrative into the very core of one's cinematic soul. ""incendies"" earns its place among the pantheon of cinema that lingers, leaving an indelible mark on those fortunate enough to bear witness. A testament to the transformative power of storytelling.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9503785/?ref_=tt_urv
17,123. 1917,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt8579674,1917- A well done WWI film,"I feel like 1917 does a good job at showcasing the fighting during World War I. It shows the trenches as well troop morale during the war. I feel like people have more interest in the second world war than the first and there's way more WWII content out there than of WWI. This one is a piece of the WWI content out there I like to see more of. World War I is what the second one is based on and I'm surprised to not see it adapted into film as much as WWII has. I hope that it gets adapted more down the line. Side rant over, time to talk more about this film. It focuses on the British side of the war. It takes place near the end of the war, in the year 1917. There's a lot of action in it, way more action than talking. It's based on the stories told by writer-director Sam Mendez's grandfather, in which some creative liberties taken. Overall, a solid WWI film.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9528066/?ref_=tt_urv
18,125. Der Untergang,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0363163,This is a must-watch movie...,"With his 2004 movie ""Der Untergang"" (aka ""Downfall""), director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered quite an amazing movie. This is such a hard-hitting movie and one that most definitely deserves to be seen, regardless of you having an interest in World War II or not. Why? Well, because it is a powerful story and one that proves that history must never be forgotten.Writer Bernd Eichinger put together a powerful and memorable script and story, based on the books by Joachim Fest, Traudl Junge and Melissa Müller. The storyline told in ""Der Untergang"" is one that will stick with you for a long time.I am really amazed with the storytelling in ""Der Untergang"", because director Oliver Hirschbiegel takes the audience along on a very emotional journey throughout the 156 minutes that the movie runs for. You might think that 156 minutes is a long runtime, but it actually is not, because the story is so nicely told, so interesting and so encompassing that you just get swept up and carried along the narrative as it unfolds and shows the last days of the regime of Adolf Hitler and the end of his Third Reich.Leading actor Bruno Ganz, playing Adolf Hitler, puts on such an amazing performance in this movie that it is hard not to be impressed. Bruno Ganz's performance in ""Der Untergang"" is so powerful that his performance alone makes the movie well-worth watching. In fact, the entire cast ensemble in the movie put on great performances individually, and that really added so much to the overall presentation of the movie.""Der Untergang"" is a movie that leaves quite an impression upon the viewer.And the fact that everything is kept in German, and some Russian language as well, makes it all the more believable and authentic. If this movie was dubbed, it would be an affront to writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel.The costume and props departments worked their magic to make ""Der Untergang"" look and feel like a proper World War II movie, which definitely was a crucial factor for the overall impact of the movie. It looks and feels the way it is supposed to, and that kind of authenticism really makes all the difference.If you haven't already seen ""Der Untergang"", then you most certainly should do so, should you get the chance. This is a must-watch movie.My rating of ""Der Untergang"" lands on a nine out of ten stars.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521153/?ref_=tt_urv
19,136. Judgment at Nuremberg,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0055031,"""Dr. Ernst Janning made his life excrement because he walked with them.""","There were other trials other than all the NSPD biggies. This is a play about the trial of the German judges. The trial was extremely intriguing and there is not a wasted thought or word.This film is excellent and well-cast. Surprisingly, there is William Shatner as Captain Harrison Byers from West Point before he became the flamboyant Captain Kirk we know of today. Burt Lancaster as Dr. Ernst Janning Made the best speech. I kept waiting for him to show his iconic Lancaster teeth. Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood was excellent in showing the conundrum of the time. There are way too many actors to cover them all; so, surprise yourself and watch the film before looking at the cast list.The Nuremberg trials held in the American zone ended July 14, 1949. There were ninety-nine defendants sentenced to prison terms. Not one is still serving his sentence.The DVD I watched had many extras:
