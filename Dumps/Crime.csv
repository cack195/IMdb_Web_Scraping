1,2. The Godfather,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0068646,PART 1 & PART 2 ARE THE GOATS!,"I've watched this mutlple times a year since we've been able to pull up our favorite movies. Now as a screenwriter and currently working on my first film The Godfather has been one of the films that has taking my storytelling to another level. It has all the components to a perfect screenplay.Watching old interviews and blogs on the making of the films really made it more interesting to watch. Breaking down why wouldn't they wouldn't want Al Pacino and other actors for their roles. The battle with Marlon Brando. The real connection to the mob. Not to mention the constant battle with the studio. Francis quitting multiple times, etc. All that was needed to cook up up this classic.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536766/?ref_=tt_urv
2,3. The Dark Knight,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0468569,The Real Dark Knight,"I have to say.The BEST movie i've seen.Excellent storyline, and the most important thing is that when you step out of the movie theatre YOU want to be The Dark Knight.Which is basically the main purpose of a comic movie.Basically the only super hero with no superpowers, yet you still want to be Batman, just goes to show how amazing this movie was directed.The whole cast played their parts perfectly, especially Heath Ledger, his performance was truly Oscar worthy.I have watched this movie so many times and it just never gets old.I'm so glad Christopher Nolan decided to direct a Batman movie, or we wouldn't one of the best movies ever directed.Just Phenomenal!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540698/?ref_=tt_urv
3,4. The Godfather: Part II,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0071562,Monumental achievement in the realm of sequels,"""The Godfather Part II"" stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of sequels, a cinematic triumph that not only lives up to its predecessor but elevates the narrative to unparalleled heights. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful continuation of the Corleone saga weaves a dual narrative that intertwines the past and present, unraveling a rich tapestry of power, ambition, and the complexities of legacy.The film deftly navigates two timelines: the rise of Vito Corleone, portrayed with magnetic charisma by Robert De Niro, and the reign of his son, Michael Corleone, portrayed once again by Al Pacino, as he grapples with the challenges of maintaining the family's empire. De Niro's portrayal of the young Vito offers a compelling glimpse into the formative years of the iconic character, showcasing his journey from an immigrant seeking justice to a formidable force in the world of organized crime.Al Pacino's reprisal of Michael Corleone is a tour de force, capturing the character's transformation into a ruthless and calculating leader while delving deeper into his internal struggles and moral conflicts. Pacino's nuanced performance adds layers to Michael's complexity, making his descent into darkness and isolation all the more haunting and tragic.Coppola's direction weaves these parallel narratives seamlessly, drawing poignant parallels between the father's ascent to power and the son's precarious grip on the empire. The film's visual storytelling, coupled with its evocative score and stunning cinematography, creates an immersive experience that resonates long after the credits roll.Beyond its captivating performances and technical prowess, ""The Godfather Part II"" delves into themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the cyclical nature of power. It challenges viewers to ponder the cost of ambition and the weight of familial expectations while painting a vivid portrait of the American Dream and its darker undercurrents.The film's intricate storytelling, rich character development, and thematic depth solidify its status as not just a sequel but a standalone masterpiece. Its impact on cinema extends beyond its accolades, serving as a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring fascination with the Corleone family's saga.In essence, ""The Godfather Part II"" is a cinematic triumph-a saga of Shakespearean proportions that transcends the boundaries of its genre, leaving an indelible mark on the tapestry of filmmaking.

The acting is phenomenal without doubts. The storytelling is so perfectly made in a matter of less than three weeks while having almost only one set.I watched this film for an english class and I got to say that since then, I haven't seen cinema the same way. Me, who wanted to be a lawyer while being passionate with acting, was in paradise watching this. Sure, they're not lawyers but Fonda's eloquence equals a lawyer's. He was so convincing yet the movie never gives us an actual answer, to the point where at the end I believe Fonda's point of view while still wondering if he was right.We never know...",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537129/?ref_=tt_urv
5,8. Pulp Fiction,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0110912,The genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a cinematic whirlwind, a genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions, enthralling audiences with its bold narrative structure, razor-sharp dialogue, and kaleidoscope of eccentric characters. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, this film is a postmodern collage, blending crime, dark humor, and philosophical musings into an electrifying tapestry of interconnected stories.Tarantino's non-linear storytelling propels viewers through a series of vignettes that intersect and intertwine, crafting a narrative mosaic that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. From hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) navigating philosophical debates in between violent encounters to the captivating dance of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent, each story thread is woven with meticulous detail and Tarantino's trademark wit.The film's dialogue crackles with intensity and pop culture references, elevating mundane conversations to moments of riveting tension or dark comedy. Tarantino's ability to infuse seemingly trivial discussions with profound depth and humor is a testament to his mastery of language and storytelling.What sets ""Pulp Fiction"" apart is its ensemble cast, each actor breathing life into their eccentric characters with unparalleled charisma. Travolta's revival as a leading man, Jackson's commanding presence, Thurman's enigmatic allure, and standout performances from a stellar supporting cast create an ensemble dynamic that keeps the film's momentum pulsating.The film's eclectic soundtrack, ranging from surf rock to soul, serves as an auditory backdrop that enhances the film's unique rhythm and atmosphere. Tarantino's use of music is not just complementary but integral to the film's identity, each song adding depth and texture to the scenes they accompany.At its core, ""Pulp Fiction"" is more than a crime film; it's a bold exploration of morality, chance, and the human condition. It revels in the chaos of existence, embracing the absurdity and unpredictability of life while inviting audiences to revel in its intoxicating blend of violence and humor.Decades after its release, ""Pulp Fiction"" remains a cultural touchstone, influencing filmmakers and captivating audiences with its audacious storytelling and indelible characters.

6,17. GoodFellas,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0099685,"Goodfellas: A Cinematic Rollercoaster Through Mob Life, Scorsese's Masterpiece Earns a Solid 8/10 for Its Intensity and Timeless Appeal","Goodfellas, an 8, dude! Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the mob world, and it's a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and raw. De Niro and Pesci are like the OGs of the gangster game, bringing the characters to life with an unmatched intensity.The storytelling is on point - it's like you're in on the heists, the schemes, and the betrayals. The soundtrack, bro, it's a mixtape of classic hits that elevate the whole vibe. From 'Layla' during the helicopter scene to 'Gimme Shelter' in the aftermath, it's a symphony of crime and chaos. The camera work, especially the famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, is pure genius - a rollercoaster through the glitz and grit of the mob life.Sure, it's not a perfect 10 because some parts drag a bit, but that doesn't take away from the overall ride. 'Goodfellas' is like a cinematic rollercoaster - fast, intense, and a bit dangerous. It's a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of mob life without the consequences. A solid 8 because it's a classic that stands the test of time, leaving you with a mix of awe and a twisted appreciation for the mob's twisted world.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536253/?ref_=tt_urv
7,19. Se7en,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114369,Riveting despite the plot holes,"Fincher's mastery of mise en scene is probably never better than here in Se7en. Like Virgil, Fincher guides us through Hell, but Hell on Earth, designed around a serial killer using the Biblical seven deadly sins as his motive. The scenes of death (always post crime) are meticulously filmed and edited to ensure we are never mere observers but at one with the ongoing investigation and as we spiral down deeper into the abyss the world around us becomes more terrifying, none more so than that of the prostitute killing. Interspersed is a brilliant chase scene during a rainstorm where even the weather seems to be weaponised.Morgan Freeman is simply peerless and doesn't put a foot wrong. Brad Pitt, for me, struggles with his delivery at times, almost overacting to try and make the point but his physicality and screen presence is comparable with Steve McQueen at his finest and brilliantly handles his wordless part in the demoument, the despair of wanting revenge and trying to resist, riddled in his eyes.Spacey appears only briefly, but his character, like Harry Lime in The Third Man, kept in the background, haunts subsequent viewings.My one problem is with the demouement and I'm sure it will be contentious with Se7en fans.The power of what John Doe does is his belief that he is wreaking vengeance on those that deserve it - cue his valedictory in the car en route to the final scene, where he espouses the righteousness of his actions. How, one might ask, does his final killing of Tracy fit that scenario? She is simply a pregnant wife scared for the future of her baby being born into such a cruel world. John Doe, knowing this, despatches an innocent victim in a despicable manner and contrary to the design of his previous murders. We discover that this is designed to provoke Mills, who has shown his penchant for losing his temper, to despatch John Doe and complete the deadly sin cycle of Covetousness (John Doe) and Wrath (Mills) but in doing so this consigns John Doe's actions to that of yet another serial killer and diminishes the power of the original premise.I believe the script acknowledges the problematic, introducing the dialogue from John Doe's telephone converstion with Mills after his apartment is discovered, where John Doe informs the detectives he will have to alter his plans, insinuating that there were different envy/wrath punishments in the offing. What these were we are never told but we presume the ultimate outcome of these would still have been the self-sacrifice of John Doe at the end and with the best will in the world I can't see how he would've achieved that.It's a small criticism of a film that, more than many at the end of the nineties, encapsultes the violence of the 20th century and prophesizes the fears of the 21st.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537204/?ref_=tt_urv
8,23. The Silence of the Lambs,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0102926,I need to watch this again,"I finished watching this movie and have spent over an hour trying to answer my lingering questions. This led me through a bunch of YouTube videos that broke down just how complex and layered this movie is with hidden messages that make it so incredible. I also ended up going through Reddit posts and finally got all the answers to my questions but not until I learned info from the book that's not in the movie. Without it, I'm not sure how the audience is expected to piece everything together. So this is absolutely a movie that I want to and need to watch again. On a second watch, I think there's a good chance I will love it so much more than I already do. But for now, I can only give it an 8 because I did have so many lingering questions after it. Moving on from that, what an incredible movie. The scene where we first see Lecter is one of the creepiest feelings I've ever had. The storytelling, especially from Clarice's perspective is incredibly and the relationship that unfolds between the two of them is fascinating. Also, my jaw was literally on the floor when I saw how Lecter escapes using the ambulance. So a really incredible movie, but one I need to watch again to be able to fully understand and appreciate even more.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540463/?ref_=tt_urv

The favela is the place where war is raged, like a prison where the disparate are caged, where the currency's narcotics, with allegiances firmly fixed, the chances are you'll never get too aged. To tell the tale our navigator is called Rocket, skirts with trouble, keeps his head below the parapet, then a camera comes to hand, a chance to break out of this land, but there are those who will impose their will with threat.Still a great piece of filmmaking.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9504487/?ref_=tt_urv
10,27. The Green Mile,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0120689,A movie that you will never forget,"I love The Green Mile for a multitude of reasons. First it is a three hour movie that never gets boring, second it has great writing that is comparable to The Dark Knight, and third the characters are lovable and you actually care about them. The acting from both Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan was excellent and you could tell that they actually wanted this movie to succeed. It is a very somber film that you will remember for years. I think this is one of the rare moments when the movie was better than the source material. I hope that years later this movie will be remembered as one of the best movies ever made.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536750/?ref_=tt_urv
11,38. Léon,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0110413,Why is this so highly-rated??,"Luc Besson or whatever his name is should be investigated. Search his computers. His DVD collection. EVERYTHING. No but seriously, dude has a serious problem with sexualisation of children.""Oh but that's part of the story! She's falling love with Léon!!1!""
That's not what I mean. I mean the very specific cinematographic choices.No wonder this was cut to bits for releases in other countries.Portman is overrated, btw. Sure, an accomplishment for a child. But the way this performance is praised? Ridiculous. Reno is solid. Nicely nuanced. Oldman is the absolute MVP. Unhinged in best of ways. There is crazy overacted cringe to stand out. And then there's Oldman. Definitely one of his best ever.The music is OBNOXIOUS.If you fail to develop emotional depth as a director. Slapping overly dramatic and LOUD music on 90% of the runtime doesn't make up for it.The plot holes are ridiculous.The police ""protocols"" are so incredibly over the top, makes it look like a satire while taking itself too serious in other scenes.While some dialogue gems are to be found. The majority, especially in the first half, is an outright crime to the art of writing.No child, ever, on planet Earth or elsewhere, would talk like Mathilda does under any circumstance ever. Not that it's too mature. That's plausible I suppose. It's just written as if a badly developed AI did the job. But what can you expect from this director.Fortunately, it picks up quality in the last act.But holymoly, the objectification of children and teens (not only Mathilda) goes CRAZY in this one. Hard to watch, unless you're rightfully on another type of watchlist.Solid, though also ridiculous, action.Looks like NYC in the 70s instead of the 90s.Why, btw?Did I miss something? But that doesn't distract that much.Give this idea to a better director and writer and you might actually have a 8,5/10 movie as how it currently (01/24) stands on IMDB.4/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535869/?ref_=tt_urv

13,40. The Departed,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0407887,I love it!,"The Departed is a movie that combines impulsive and precise collage assembly, which is so energetic that it even infiltrates the post-production. The movie utilizes constant parallel editing and sudden music cues that repeat and cut out of nowhere, which makes it feel radical even after several years since it was released. The movie's construction is truly wild, and it is hard to describe it with words. The film has no rhythm, just a love for abrupt recycling. Jack Nicholson walks out of the shadows four different times in the first ten minutes, and his character's performance is crude. However, that kind of messy and blunt performance is able to exist in a carefully calibrated film such as this.The movie juggles one scene with five other scenes and fifty cutaways, but it all moves forward in a logical way. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is so isolated and tormented, and his life is overtly juxtaposed against Matt Damon's character's life. This enhances DiCaprio's character's predicament, making us feel even more for him and loathe Damon even more. Thelma Schoonmaker did a great job of assembling the movie in such a way that it is intricate and freewheeling.The movie has a lot of energy and piecemeal bits to burn, which makes it seem like the film took on a life of its own and got away from the filmmakers at the finish line. The final shot, which is terribly ham-fisted, illustrates this weird energy that The Departed has. However, it adds to the movie's charm, making it unique and fun to watch.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535654/?ref_=tt_urv

The Usual Suspects,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114814,The masterclass in storytelling-an intricately woven crime thriller,"""The Usual Suspects"" is a masterclass in storytelling-an intricately woven crime thriller that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats until its breathtaking conclusion. Directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie, this film is a gripping exploration of deception, manipulation, and the elusive nature of truth.The narrative centers around a police interrogation of the sole survivor of a massacre and a heist gone wrong, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). As Kint recounts the events leading up to the tragedy, a web of intrigue unfolds, involving a group of criminals with shadowy connections to the enigmatic crime lord Keyser Söze.What sets ""The Usual Suspects"" apart is its non-linear storytelling and unreliable narrator, which keeps viewers guessing until the final revelatory moments. McQuarrie's sharp script and Singer's deft direction create an atmosphere of tension and suspense, crafting a narrative puzzle that challenges audiences to piece together the truth.The film is propelled by a stellar ensemble cast, with standout performances from Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, and Kevin Pollak. Spacey's portrayal of Verbal Kint is particularly memorable, exuding a cunning charm that keeps the audience second-guessing his motives until the shocking climax.""The Usual Suspects"" is renowned for its twist ending-one that subverts expectations and reshapes the entire narrative. This unexpected conclusion, coupled with the film's intricate plot and character dynamics, invites multiple viewings to uncover the layers of deception woven into the story.The film's legacy as a gripping and cleverly crafted crime thriller endures, earning its place as a cult classic in the genre. Its impact lies in its ability to keep audiences engaged, questioning the nature of truth and the depths of deception, long after the credits roll.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534475/?ref_=tt_urv
15,65. Witness for the Prosecution,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0051201,Clever and remarkably entertaining courtroom drama,"This clever and remarkably entertaining courtroom drama is quite possible the best big-screen adaptation of any Agatha Christie story. The film stars an obesely overweight and delightfully arrogant Charles Laughton as an expert defence barrister who takes on a seemingly impossible case of defending a good-natured American man (Tyrone Power) in a murder case full of circumstantial evidence - including the statement of his wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich), which may or may not implicate him. Fans of crackerjack writing will be treated to plenty of intellectual banter and delightful twists, right up until the very end. Crisp black-and-white cinematography by Russell Harlan and skilful narrative pacing courtesy of veteran director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard) make the movie a feast for eyes and mind despite a very limited number of locations. Laughton is superb as the lethargic and acerbic but very much principled Sir Wilfrid. This was Tyrone Power's last fully completed film before his sudden death in Madrid a year after its release.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9508284/?ref_=tt_urv
16,80. Joker,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt7286456,Society is terrible,"This is probably one of the most successful examples of a gorgeous solo film about some popular character.The Joker was played by the inimitable Joaquin Phoenix (known for his role in Gladiator), and people comparing him to Ledger are very narrow-minded, because Phoenix showed us a completely new Joker, who is gorgeous in his own way.The plot tells about a sick man Arthur, who suffers eternal ridicule over himself, lives and cares for his mother, and also dreams of being accepted by people, thanks to his performance on Murray's favorite humor show (De Niro)
As a result, we will see a man becoming a monster because of our society, of course not without his mental illness, but the nature of people clearly pushed the main character to become a Joker.This is a gorgeous dramatic thriller, with some cool reference for the future (little Bruce, Thomas Wayne, etc.), which is a must-watch!

As the friends grow in power and skill, it cuts in the pockets of a local gangster leader. He murders one of the crew and one of the crew then murders him and goes to jail.

And there's a little cat and mouse where it's always fascinating how the police work together to capture this perpetrator.

Not a lot of action so don't watch it if you're looking for an action movie, it's more of a psychological trip. Great plot and lots of twists and turns, lots and lots of foul language, and graphic violence. No nudity or questionable content whatsoever.

He came out of the world war II with a heavy defeat and 2. It was shot in a country where fascism is rising, where the world war is being felt.The main crucial event of the film is hidden at the end. The fact that the director leaves the question of who is to blame to you, the pressure of society , everything remains on your conscience.I won't strongly recommend watching it, but watching the social structure of the period, the first examples of film noir, although unknown, and the genius who directed a film like persopolis is a good experience to explore. 8/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9479065/?ref_=tt_urv
