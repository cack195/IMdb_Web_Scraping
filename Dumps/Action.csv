The Dark Knight,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0468569,The Real Dark Knight,"I have to say.The BEST movie i've seen.Excellent storyline, and the most important thing is that when you step out of the movie theatre YOU want to be The Dark Knight.Which is basically the main purpose of a comic movie.Basically the only super hero with no superpowers, yet you still want to be Batman, just goes to show how amazing this movie was directed.The whole cast played their parts perfectly, especially Heath Ledger, his performance was truly Oscar worthy.I have watched this movie so many times and it just never gets old.I'm so glad Christopher Nolan decided to direct a Batman movie, or we wouldn't one of the best movies ever directed.Just Phenomenal!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540698/?ref_=tt_urv
2,7. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0167260,THE BEST OF ALL TIME,"Visually, ""The Return of the King"" is a marvel. The grandiose landscapes, intricate costumes and breathtaking special effects create a world that is both magical and authentic. The attention to detail in depicting the different cultures and creatures of Middle-earth is simply remarkable.What really sets this film apart is its emotional depth. The characters face unimaginable trials, testing their determination and loyalty. Themes of friendship, courage and the struggle between good and evil are addressed with such sincerity that they resonate deeply with audiences. The performances, particularly those by actors like Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen, are incredibly moving, allowing viewers to connect deeply with the characters.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538575/?ref_=tt_urv

This film cannot get any better than what it already is. Sheer perfection, commendable performances and amazing way to coven the story within the cinema timelines.Nowhere did the film felt dragged or slow, which I was worried it might. It's a viewer spectacle at it's best.Even if you haven't read the book, go ahead and watch this movie.

4,13. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0167261,Damn.....,"This movie was definitely not as good as the first film, but damn was it still good. I remember watching this as a kid and not understanding anything but still liked it. And now that ive grown i absolutely love it, the character development of frodo and of Aragorn is just so good. Gandalf becoming gandalf the white was so sick, and the overall fantasy element is top tier. The only thing that is really an L in this film is the developing love of the princess (forgot her name) and Aragorn. Like i personally dont see it and it seems forced. I would understand him leaving the elf girl, since it was inevitable and he genuinely loved her and did what was best for her, but the relarionship with the princess? Not really liking it. Its a very small complaint and very picky. Other than that, great film. 100% recommend.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538687/?ref_=tt_urv
5,14. Inception,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1375666,A Smart Summer Blockbuster!,"Christopher Nolan knocked it out of the park with Inception. A movie that is about a dream within a dream within another dream. Basically there are 4 stages to the dream here. Inception shows that a smart movie can still be considered a Summer Blockbuster instead of a mindless action film. The movie features an A list cast with a lot of Nolan familars like Tom Hardy, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Michael Caine. Leo is of course the main lead here and he puts on a great performance of someone who is internally conflicted but is also trying to help his team pull off an impossible heist. Those that say this movie is to confusing or don't understand need to pay attention more as Nolan pretty much plays everything out here to follow. Inception is a film that is meant to be experienced and will be considered a classic. Inception gets 10 stars out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9533970/?ref_=tt_urv
6,15. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0080684,The best Star Wars film of all time,"The Empire Strikes Back is arguably more Space Opera than science fiction, but whatever it is, it's damned fine entertainment and highly re-watchable. The physical and meta-physical training of farm-boy Luke is an important part of this film, and Yoda amazes -- the only Muppet ever to seem like an organic being and not a puppet.""Do. Or do not. There is no try.""SO many things could have gone wrong with this ambitious project, and none of them did. Like the best Star Wars films, the final shot is moving and has great music (the entire soundtrack is excellent).10/10 -- I don't give out this rating lightly (esp. For a sequel).",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536391/?ref_=tt_urv

The Matrix,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0133093,The groundbreaking piece of cinematic innovation,"""The Matrix"" isn't just a film; it's a groundbreaking piece of cinematic innovation that redefined action movies and challenged the very perception of reality. Directed by the Wachowskis, this sci-fi masterpiece combines mind-bending concepts, stunning visual effects, and philosophical depth to create a cinematic experience that continues to captivate audiences.The story follows Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who goes by the alias Neo (Keanu Reeves), as he discovers that the world he knows is a simulated reality-a computer-generated dream created by sentient machines that have enslaved humanity. Neo joins a rebellion led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) to free humanity from the Matrix and uncover his true destiny as ""The One.""""The Matrix"" captivated audiences with its groundbreaking visual effects, including the iconic ""bullet time"" sequences, which redefined action cinematography and set a new standard for visual storytelling. The film's innovative use of CGI and martial arts choreography created a visually stunning and immersive experience.Beyond its technical achievements, ""The Matrix"" is rich in philosophical and existential themes. It delves into questions of reality, free will, and the nature of control, inviting audiences to contemplate the boundaries between perception and truth.The performances, particularly Reeves as the reluctant hero Neo and Fishburne's enigmatic Morpheus, anchor the film's narrative with gravitas and conviction. The chemistry among the cast members and their dedication to their roles contribute to the film's enduring impact.The film's cultural influence extends far beyond the silver screen, permeating into popular culture and inspiring discussions on technology, consciousness, and the nature of existence.

8,21. Shichinin No Samurai,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0047478,both sides have their own pain,"I thought I would think ""it was already amazing to be able to film like this back then,"" but after watching it, I realized that ""many directors, especially Chinese directors, cannot produce this kind of shooting effect today."" In 2019, I re watched this film and discovered many details. At the beginning of the story, I was looking for a samurai companion. When the master asked my disciple to attack the samurai with a wooden stick, several farmers quickly retreated. As the retreat was too natural, I had overlooked this detail in the past. However, this retreat action showed that the farmers shifted the responsibility onto the samurai (master) and did not want to bear the anger of the attacked samurai, even though they should be the main responsible person, not the master hired by them. There was also a disciple who secretly paid the farmers to buy rice, which was a gesture of gratitude. However, when the master considered that the disciple was young and did not allow him to participate in the fight, the farmers were eager for the disciple to join in. Of course, Akira Kurosawa does not have brainless black farmers. As Kikuchiyo said, although farmers are cunning and selfish, this is the character of farmers caused by the war of the samurai class. The samurai is very arrogant, the farmer is also very selfish, and both sides have their own pain. It is the farmer Kikuchiyo who wants to become a samurai who witnesses all of this.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540968/?ref_=tt_urv
9,28. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0076759,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a flawed masterpiece, an adventure you won't forget that pushed the boundaries of special effects - My Ultimate Review","Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a sci-fi masterpiece, although it has some flaws it's just easy to look past. This is a Star Wars film I've seen more times than I can count and now it's my second time seeing it on 4K Blu-ray, honestly, each frame looks stunning and is full of detail. This is one of those 4k remasters which is simply perfect with Dolby Vision and HDR which enhances the experience and picture quality immensely. The Dolby Atmos track is too perfect, making it easy to understand why the film won an award for best sound and music. George Lucas directed and wrote the film, also creating ILM for the extensive special effects work on the film. It's a flawed masterpiece as with this film, you see the flaws that George clearly has, but how he went through with his vision and stuck with it. We got one of the best sci-fi films and possibly the best sci-fi franchise thanks to him, a storyteller and visionary. Star Wars was a surprise hit, surpassing Jaws (1975) to become the highest-grossing film until the release of E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982); subsequent releases brought its total gross to $775 million. When adjusted for inflation, Star Wars is the second-highest-grossing film in North America and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time.Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a Wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle station, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the mysterious Darth Vader.There's a ton of likable characters in this trilogy (Episode IV-VI) and this was the start. We have an inexperienced Mark Hamill who plays Luke Skywalker, what's interesting is how you see his acting improve throughout the film. Then we have Harrison Ford as the charismatic Han Solo who gets all the funny lines which are made funny because of his delivery. His performance is one of the highlights, I could say the same about Hamill and Fisher's who got a career after this film. We have Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa, Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO and Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca. On the villain side we have; Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin, David Prowse as Darth Vader with James Earl Jones doing the voice for the character, a voice a bit unknown back in the day, but a voice that became iconic. The characters are excellent and the acting can be all from good to average and even below average at times, but that's completely alright with a film with this much heart. I can't help to smile, laugh, and be entertained every single time I watch this film.It's known to the public how George Lucas was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's films, for example The Hidden Fortress with Toshiro Mifune being Lucas' number one pick for Obi-Wan Kenobi but it wasn't meant to be instead we got Alec Guinness in the role which was great. Regarding the inspiration of The Hidden Fortress, you see how the story and characters were heavily inspired. The two peasants from that film who banter with each other throughout the movie, you see their personalities in R2D2 and 3CPO. Then we have the samurai and princess, Jedi and Princess in this film. Another big influence was of course Flash Gordon but I'll go into another one, Lawrence of Arabia (1962) which inspired the film's visual approach, including long-lens desert shots. There are also thematic parallels, including the freedom fight by a rebel army against an empire, and politicians who meddle behind the scenes. He uses this inspiration and creates something brilliant, something memorable, a landmark in cinema. One big reason for why it's so memorable, is because of the production design and art direction, it's truly something special, with Ralph McQuarrie's concept art and illustrations helping make Star Wars so special and epic.This film, the first Star Wars film, has some mesmerizing shots. The film looks absolutely stunning and it's thanks to the brilliant cinematography by Gilbert Taylor along with the director. George Lucas had a new camera made for the film for the extensive special effects shots. Dykstra's development of this first digital motion control camera system earned himself, Al Miller, and Jerry Jeffress Academy Awards in 1978. If I would have been at the cinema during the theatrical release, I would have been completely mind blown of the special effects, they have aged like fine wine. The film is almost fifty years old and it'll hold up in fifty more years. John Williams' musical score makes the film so much better, it's not the best score in the trilogy though but what he contributed to the film will be remembered for centuries.Roger Ebert said this in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, ""What makes the Star Wars experience unique, though, is that it happens on such an innocent and often funny level. It's usually violence that draws me so deeply into a movie-violence ranging from the psychological torment of a Bergman character to the mindless crunch of a shark's jaws. Maybe movies that scare us find the most direct route to our imaginations. But there's hardly any violence at all in Star Wars (and even then it's presented as essentially bloodless swashbuckling). Instead, there's entertainment so direct and simple that all of the complications of the modern movie seem to vaporize."" and called the film ""an out-of-body experience"", compared its special effects to those of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and opined that the true strength of the film was its ""pure narrative"". The film garnered numerous accolades after its release. Star Wars won six competitive Academy Awards at the 50th Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. Additional nominations included Alec Guinness for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and George Lucas for Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. The film also received twelve nominations at the Saturn Awards, winning nine: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, and Best Writing for George Lucas; Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness. Star Wars - A New Hope attained the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation which is a great achievement.Some final words for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, I fell in love with this franchise and film when I was a kid thanks to my father. Star Wars remains a film, a trilogy, a franchise which I keep coming back to without feeling bored. I'm grateful for what George Lucas created, of all the young lives he changed. A New Hope is a brilliant film, a sci-fi film perfect in so many ways. For the ones who have never seen Star Wars before, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and still do.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539320/?ref_=tt_urv
10,29. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0103064,James Cameron + Arnold Schwarzenegger = an unbeatable combination,"The Governator is back - and this time around, his Terminator (who still isn't much of a conversationalist) is the good guy.The plot is fairly similar: Terminator goes back in time to kill John Connor (after failing to kill his mother in the first film) and Arnold's reformed/reprogrammed bad guy is sent back by future John Connor to save the world by stopping Judgement Day.Arnold's Terminator is perfectly humanised through his interactions with Edward Furlong's young John Connor.The new prototype Terminator is played by Robert Patrick, with the same unsmiling face and lack of words. He portrays a menacing villain, drawing from Arnold's original performance of seven years earlier.T2, a 90's actioner through and through, is fantastic from the word go: spectacular action sequences that manage to be bigger and bolder than the first film - which is really saying something - some funny moments, a dash of sci-fi, a cool soundtrack, perfect storyline, and brilliant direction from James Cameron. (Side note: Arnie's best work is generally under Cameron's guidance.)",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540057/?ref_=tt_urv
11,30. Spider-man: Across the Spider-verse,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt9362722,A Visually Stunning and Compelling Sequel,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic film! First off, it is visually stunning, and it's evident that a considerable amount of time and effort went into its creation. The visuals alone tell a compelling story of characters' emotions and set the tone for each scene. The cast, much like in the previous film, delivers outstanding performances, with Hailee Steinfeld particularly standing out in this one. The character progression of Miles from the first movie is a highlight, especially as the film places him at a crossroads. The soundtrack is among the best in recent memory, leaving a lasting impact even after the credits roll. The exploration of family themes is well-executed, although the second half slightly dips in this regard for the reviewer. The only downside I have is that much of the film's advertisement centered around the second half, which created a sense of having seen a huge portion of it already. The film also ends somewhat abruptly, but this is expected from the first part of a series. Overall, it stands as one of the best comic films to date in my opinion, and I think anyone could give it a watch, whether or not they enjoy superhero content.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540660/?ref_=tt_urv
12,36. Gladiator,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0172495,I love it!,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character's emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding. The end of the movie is just fantastic and it leaves a lasting impression.Overall, ""Gladiator"" is an action-packed movie with terrific acting and an engaging story. It's definitely worth watching and is a fantastic film.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540300/?ref_=tt_urv

No but seriously, dude has a serious problem with sexualisation of children.""Oh but that's part of the story! She's falling love with Léon!!1!""
That's not what I mean. I mean the very specific cinematographic choices.No wonder this was cut to bits for releases in other countries.Portman is overrated, btw. Sure, an accomplishment for a child. But the way this performance is praised? Ridiculous. Reno is solid. Nicely nuanced. Oldman is the absolute MVP. Unhinged in best of ways. There is crazy overacted cringe to stand out. And then there's Oldman. Definitely one of his best ever.The music is OBNOXIOUS.If you fail to develop emotional depth as a director. Slapping overly dramatic and LOUD music on 90% of the runtime doesn't make up for it.The plot holes are ridiculous.The police ""protocols"" are so incredibly over the top, makes it look like a satire while taking itself too serious in other scenes.While some dialogue gems are to be found. The majority, especially in the first half, is an outright crime to the art of writing.No child, ever, on planet Earth or elsewhere, would talk like Mathilda does under any circumstance ever. Not that it's too mature. That's plausible I suppose. It's just written as if a badly developed AI did the job. But what can you expect from this director.Fortunately, it picks up quality in the last act.But holymoly, the objectification of children and teens (not only Mathilda) goes CRAZY in this one. Hard to watch, unless you're rightfully on another type of watchlist.Solid, though also ridiculous, action.Looks like NYC in the 70s instead of the 90s.Why, btw?Did I miss something? But that doesn't distract that much.Give this idea to a better director and writer and you might actually have a 8,5/10 movie as how it currently (01/24) stands on IMDB.4/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9535869/?ref_=tt_urv

15,57. Raiders of the Lost Ark,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0082971,"An action-packed romp, full of classic movie tropes","Booby traps, being chased by a rolling boulder, falling into a pit of snakes - this movie is full of tropes which have been used time and time again. I am led to believe this movie may be the origin of many of these cliches, though they are executed in an entertaining fashion. As the movie develops, so does the intensity of the action. It's enjoyable from start to finish and gets you hooked immediately.Harrison Ford plays action hero Indiana Jones. He has some of the strongest plot armour I've ever seen in a character, but I was rooting for him throughout nonetheless. I enjoyed Karen Allen's character Marion too, and I'm glad they didn't lean too much into the damsel in distress trope and made her an exciting character on her own too. John Rhys-Davies' Sallah was a warm character who provided some comic relief in his scenes. The major villain, Ronald Lacey's Arnold Toht, was surprisingly terrifying and I found myself quite nervous in the scenes he was in - he did a good job! The heavy action throughout the movie is enjoyable, but perhaps at the expense of a lack of character depth and emotion.I have a few qualms with the story, which is why I haven't rated it any higher. Despite being pivotal to the plot, I couldn't understand the concept of the ark and why it was perceived as important by the characters, especially as there was so much uncertainty as to what it was. The scene where it opens switched the genre and tone slightly, adding supernatural elements much too late in the movie in my opinion, at least for it to feel believable as part of the story.Nonetheless, a solid movie, and worth a watch!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540117/?ref_=tt_urv

18,67. Alien 2,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0090605,A Spectacular Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is a sensational continuation of Ridley Scott's Alien, taking the franchise to new heights and solidifying itself as an extraordinary science fiction masterpiece. This action-packed and suspenseful film not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every aspect, delivering an unforgettable cinematic experience.Set several decades after the events of the first film, Aliens immerses us in a future where humans have colonized other planets.

The practical effects are exceptional, and the attention to detail is remarkable. The tension and chaos are palpable, making these sequences some of the most memorable in cinematic history.In addition to its technical brilliance, Aliens also pushes the boundaries of storytelling, exploring the unknown and questioning our place in the universe. It raises philosophical questions about the nature of life, the consequences of our actions, and the lengths we would go to protect those we care about. These themes resonate long after the credits roll, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.In conclusion, Aliens is a masterpiece of the science fiction genre.

Oldeuboi,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0364569,worth watching and thinking,"Frankly speaking, it's a great film, even though the storyline seems absurd, shocking, and against the common social morality. Never gossip others' personal life as long as it wouldn't interfere with our own interests. People should learn to respect and tolerate with each other's social behavior as long as it wouldn't physically hurt anyone and do real harm to the stability of our society. At the very least, if you don't agree with other people's ""bizarre"" but non-harmful behavior, you can simply choose not to socialize with them and let them be. People should never ever publicly expose others' privacy, let alone insulting those who are different from us. Anyway, I think we all can learn a thing or two from this movie, even though most of us might feel extremely uncomfortable with these shocking scenes.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540509/?ref_=tt_urv
