2,2. The Godfather,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0068646,PART 1 & PART 2 ARE THE GOATS!,"I've watched this mutlple times a year since we've been able to pull up our favorite movies. Now as a screenwriter and currently working on my first film The Godfather has been one of the films that has taking my storytelling to another level. It has all the components to a perfect screenplay.Watching old interviews and blogs on the making of the films really made it more interesting to watch. Breaking down why wouldn't they wouldn't want Al Pacino and other actors for their roles. The battle with Marlon Brando. The real connection to the mob. Not to mention the constant battle with the studio. Francis quitting multiple times, etc. All that was needed to cook up up this classic.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536766/?ref_=tt_urv

4,4. The Godfather: Part II,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0071562,Monumental achievement in the realm of sequels,"""The Godfather Part II"" stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of sequels, a cinematic triumph that not only lives up to its predecessor but elevates the narrative to unparalleled heights. Francis Ford Coppola's masterful continuation of the Corleone saga weaves a dual narrative that intertwines the past and present, unraveling a rich tapestry of power, ambition, and the complexities of legacy.The film deftly navigates two timelines: the rise of Vito Corleone, portrayed with magnetic charisma by Robert De Niro, and the reign of his son, Michael Corleone, portrayed once again by Al Pacino, as he grapples with the challenges of maintaining the family's empire. De Niro's portrayal of the young Vito offers a compelling glimpse into the formative years of the iconic character, showcasing his journey from an immigrant seeking justice to a formidable force in the world of organized crime.Al Pacino's reprisal of Michael Corleone is a tour de force, capturing the character's transformation into a ruthless and calculating leader while delving deeper into his internal struggles and moral conflicts. Pacino's nuanced performance adds layers to Michael's complexity, making his descent into darkness and isolation all the more haunting and tragic.Coppola's direction weaves these parallel narratives seamlessly, drawing poignant parallels between the father's ascent to power and the son's precarious grip on the empire. The film's visual storytelling, coupled with its evocative score and stunning cinematography, creates an immersive experience that resonates long after the credits roll.Beyond its captivating performances and technical prowess, ""The Godfather Part II"" delves into themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the cyclical nature of power. It challenges viewers to ponder the cost of ambition and the weight of familial expectations while painting a vivid portrait of the American Dream and its darker undercurrents.The film's intricate storytelling, rich character development, and thematic depth solidify its status as not just a sequel but a standalone masterpiece. Its impact on cinema extends beyond its accolades, serving as a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring fascination with the Corleone family's saga.In essence, ""The Godfather Part II"" is a cinematic triumph-a saga of Shakespearean proportions that transcends the boundaries of its genre, leaving an indelible mark on the tapestry of filmmaking. Its legacy lies not only in its critical acclaim but in its ability to captivate audiences with its timeless exploration of power, ambition, and the price of success.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534439/?ref_=tt_urv
5,5. 12 Angry Men,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0050083,"Mindblowing, strong, passionate","This movie has to be in my list of favorite movies of all time. It's spectacular. The acting is phenomenal without doubts. The storytelling is so perfectly made in a matter of less than three weeks while having almost only one set.I watched this film for an english class and I got to say that since then, I haven't seen cinema the same way. Me, who wanted to be a lawyer while being passionate with acting, was in paradise watching this. Sure, they're not lawyers but Fonda's eloquence equals a lawyer's. He was so convincing yet the movie never gives us an actual answer, to the point where at the end I believe Fonda's point of view while still wondering if he was right.We never know...",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537129/?ref_=tt_urv
6,6. Schindler's List,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0108052,The profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust,"""Schindler's List"" is a profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust and an ode to the power of individual conscience and compassion in the face of unfathomable evil. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a hauntingly poignant portrayal of one man's transformation from opportunist to savior amidst the atrocities of World War II.The story follows Oskar Schindler, a German businessman brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson, who initially seeks to profit from the war by employing Jewish labor in his factories. However, as he witnesses the systematic persecution and genocide of Jews under Nazi rule, Schindler undergoes a moral awakening. His efforts to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish workers, guided by his accountant Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley), become an act of defiance against the inhumanity of the Holocaust.Spielberg's direction captures the harrowing realities of the Holocaust with unflinching authenticity, employing black and white cinematography to evoke a haunting sense of history. The film's stark visuals, coupled with John Williams' haunting score, create an emotionally immersive experience that leaves an indelible impact on the audience.What sets ""Schindler's List"" apart is its unwavering portrayal of both the depths of human cruelty and the glimmer of hope found in acts of altruism. It's a narrative that confronts the darkest chapters of history while honoring the resilience and humanity of those who resisted.The performances, especially Neeson's portrayal of Schindler's gradual transformation from a profiteer to a savior, resonate with emotional depth. The supporting cast adds layers of authenticity to the characters, showcasing the resilience and tragedy of those caught in the Holocaust's grip.Beyond its cinematic achievements, ""Schindler's List"" serves as a powerful educational tool, a stark reminder of the consequences of hate and the importance of standing up against injustice. Its impact extends far beyond the screen, challenging viewers to confront the atrocities of the past and champion compassion and tolerance in the present.Decades after its release, the film remains a cinematic landmark-a testament to the filmmaker's dedication to preserving history and telling stories that transcend entertainment, leaving an enduring legacy as a powerful, emotionally raw portrayal of one of humanity's darkest chapters.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534449/?ref_=tt_urv
7,7. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0167260,THE BEST OF ALL TIME,"Visually, ""The Return of the King"" is a marvel. The grandiose landscapes, intricate costumes and breathtaking special effects create a world that is both magical and authentic. The attention to detail in depicting the different cultures and creatures of Middle-earth is simply remarkable.What really sets this film apart is its emotional depth. The characters face unimaginable trials, testing their determination and loyalty. Themes of friendship, courage and the struggle between good and evil are addressed with such sincerity that they resonate deeply with audiences.

8,8. Pulp Fiction,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0110912,The genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a cinematic whirlwind, a genre-defying masterpiece that subverts storytelling conventions, enthralling audiences with its bold narrative structure, razor-sharp dialogue, and kaleidoscope of eccentric characters. Directed by Quentin Tarantino, this film is a postmodern collage, blending crime, dark humor, and philosophical musings into an electrifying tapestry of interconnected stories.Tarantino's non-linear storytelling propels viewers through a series of vignettes that intersect and intertwine, crafting a narrative mosaic that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. From hitmen Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) navigating philosophical debates in between violent encounters to the captivating dance of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent, each story thread is woven with meticulous detail and Tarantino's trademark wit.The film's dialogue crackles with intensity and pop culture references, elevating mundane conversations to moments of riveting tension or dark comedy. Tarantino's ability to infuse seemingly trivial discussions with profound depth and humor is a testament to his mastery of language and storytelling.What sets ""Pulp Fiction"" apart is its ensemble cast, each actor breathing life into their eccentric characters with unparalleled charisma. Travolta's revival as a leading man, Jackson's commanding presence, Thurman's enigmatic allure, and standout performances from a stellar supporting cast create an ensemble dynamic that keeps the film's momentum pulsating.The film's eclectic soundtrack, ranging from surf rock to soul, serves as an auditory backdrop that enhances the film's unique rhythm and atmosphere. Tarantino's use of music is not just complementary but integral to the film's identity, each song adding depth and texture to the scenes they accompany.At its core, ""Pulp Fiction"" is more than a crime film; it's a bold exploration of morality, chance, and the human condition. It revels in the chaos of existence, embracing the absurdity and unpredictability of life while inviting audiences to revel in its intoxicating blend of violence and humor.Decades after its release, ""Pulp Fiction"" remains a cultural touchstone, influencing filmmakers and captivating audiences with its audacious storytelling and indelible characters. Its legacy as a cinematic tour de force endures, a testament to Tarantino's visionary storytelling and his ability to redefine the boundaries of narrative in cinema.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534441/?ref_=tt_urv
9,9. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0120737,JRR Tolkien couldn't be happier!,"I had read the books several times and thought of ""what would a movie look like on this title?"". This film cannot get any better than what it already is. Sheer perfection, commendable performances and amazing way to coven the story within the cinema timelines.Nowhere did the film felt dragged or slow, which I was worried it might. It's a viewer spectacle at it's best.Even if you haven't read the book, go ahead and watch this movie. It will be worth your time and will definitely leave a lasting impression on you as a viewer.It's my go to repeat films now and can watch it several times a week.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9539860/?ref_=tt_urv
10,11. Forrest Gump,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0109830,Movie of a lifetime,"How do you review this film? This film is part drama, comedy, romance , war , fantasy
and inspiration. To meld all these qualities together is no mean feat. It works a great here. The central performance is unforgettable and he deserved his Oscar. A great soundtrack throughout. The support cast is also excellent inc Gary sinise sally field and Robin wright. It would be easy to nit pick certain things but in the realm of what this film is trying to do it doesn't matter. The most significant thing this film offers is that you feel. And you can't not. It's those indelible moments throughout that make this a masterpiece. You feel sad but at the same time you feel hope. A wonderful ending with the feather echoing both the ideas of destiny and also not knowing what's coming. A great film.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9532001/?ref_=tt_urv
11,12. Fight Club,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0137523,You might watch it twice...,"There are three things that made this movie iconic: Brad Pitt's body, the huge twist, and the ending with ""Where is my mind"" by the Pixies. Because of those things, people tend to rate this movie higher than it actually deserves. The story itself is forgettable. The plan being carried out by Tyler in the movie is forgettable. What we remember is the dissociative disorder twist that no one saw coming (kind of like The Sixth Sense) and everyone had to run back and watch the movie again to verify or understand that it had been that way the whole movie. After that second viewing, there is really no need to watch this movie ever again (also like The Sixth Sense). But we love to reward movies for stuff like that the first time around. But I tried watching this movie again recently for what would have been my third time, and I was bored with it. You will be too.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537634/?ref_=tt_urv
12,13. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0167261,Damn.....,"This movie was definitely not as good as the first film, but damn was it still good. I remember watching this as a kid and not understanding anything but still liked it. And now that ive grown i absolutely love it, the character development of frodo and of Aragorn is just so good. Gandalf becoming gandalf the white was so sick, and the overall fantasy element is top tier. The only thing that is really an L in this film is the developing love of the princess (forgot her name) and Aragorn. Like i personally dont see it and it seems forced. I would understand him leaving the elf girl, since it was inevitable and he genuinely loved her and did what was best for her, but the relarionship with the princess? Not really liking it. Its a very small complaint and very picky. Other than that, great film. 100% recommend.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538687/?ref_=tt_urv
13,17. GoodFellas,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0099685,"Goodfellas: A Cinematic Rollercoaster Through Mob Life, Scorsese's Masterpiece Earns a Solid 8/10 for Its Intensity and Timeless Appeal","Goodfellas, an 8, dude! Martin Scorsese takes you deep into the mob world, and it's a cinematic experience that's both thrilling and raw. De Niro and Pesci are like the OGs of the gangster game, bringing the characters to life with an unmatched intensity.The storytelling is on point - it's like you're in on the heists, the schemes, and the betrayals. The soundtrack, bro, it's a mixtape of classic hits that elevate the whole vibe. From 'Layla' during the helicopter scene to 'Gimme Shelter' in the aftermath, it's a symphony of crime and chaos. The camera work, especially the famous tracking shot through the Copacabana, is pure genius - a rollercoaster through the glitz and grit of the mob life.Sure, it's not a perfect 10 because some parts drag a bit, but that doesn't take away from the overall ride. 'Goodfellas' is like a cinematic rollercoaster - fast, intense, and a bit dangerous. It's a must-watch for anyone craving a taste of mob life without the consequences. A solid 8 because it's a classic that stands the test of time, leaving you with a mix of awe and a twisted appreciation for the mob's twisted world.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9536253/?ref_=tt_urv
14,18. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0073486,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest: A Cinematic Rebellion of Madness and Individuality, Earns a Perfect 10 for Unforgettable Characters and Timeless Impact.","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a perfect 10, man! Jack Nicholson's performance is off the charts - the rebellion against the system and Nurse Ratched is like the ultimate mental game. The characters are a mix of crazy, quirky, and unforgettable - it's a rollercoaster of emotions, and you're hooked from the first scene.The whole vibe of the mental institution is insane, pun intended. The rebellious spirit, the pranks, and the camaraderie are pure chaos, and it's like a rebellious anthem against conformity. The film doesn't just entertain; it makes you question authority, rules, and sanity itself. It's a cinematic journey that transcends the screen, leaving you with thoughts that linger long after the credits roll.Sure, it's not your typical blockbuster, but that's what makes it special. It's a trip into the human psyche, a rebellion against societal norms, and a testament to the power of individuality. A solid 10 because it's not just a movie; it's a masterpiece that challenges, entertains, and leaves a lasting impact. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a piece of cinematic brilliance.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9538582/?ref_=tt_urv
15,19. Se7en,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0114369,Riveting despite the plot holes,"Fincher's mastery of mise en scene is probably never better than here in Se7en. Like Virgil, Fincher guides us through Hell, but Hell on Earth, designed around a serial killer using the Biblical seven deadly sins as his motive. The scenes of death (always post crime) are meticulously filmed and edited to ensure we are never mere observers but at one with the ongoing investigation and as we spiral down deeper into the abyss the world around us becomes more terrifying, none more so than that of the prostitute killing. Interspersed is a brilliant chase scene during a rainstorm where even the weather seems to be weaponised.Morgan Freeman is simply peerless and doesn't put a foot wrong. Brad Pitt, for me, struggles with his delivery at times, almost overacting to try and make the point but his physicality and screen presence is comparable with Steve McQueen at his finest and brilliantly handles his wordless part in the demoument, the despair of wanting revenge and trying to resist, riddled in his eyes.Spacey appears only briefly, but his character, like Harry Lime in The Third Man, kept in the background, haunts subsequent viewings.My one problem is with the demouement and I'm sure it will be contentious with Se7en fans.The power of what John Doe does is his belief that he is wreaking vengeance on those that deserve it - cue his valedictory in the car en route to the final scene, where he espouses the righteousness of his actions. How, one might ask, does his final killing of Tracy fit that scenario? She is simply a pregnant wife scared for the future of her baby being born into such a cruel world. John Doe, knowing this, despatches an innocent victim in a despicable manner and contrary to the design of his previous murders. We discover that this is designed to provoke Mills, who has shown his penchant for losing his temper, to despatch John Doe and complete the deadly sin cycle of Covetousness (John Doe) and Wrath (Mills) but in doing so this consigns John Doe's actions to that of yet another serial killer and diminishes the power of the original premise.I believe the script acknowledges the problematic, introducing the dialogue from John Doe's telephone converstion with Mills after his apartment is discovered, where John Doe informs the detectives he will have to alter his plans, insinuating that there were different envy/wrath punishments in the offing. What these were we are never told but we presume the ultimate outcome of these would still have been the self-sacrifice of John Doe at the end and with the best will in the world I can't see how he would've achieved that.It's a small criticism of a film that, more than many at the end of the nineties, encapsultes the violence of the 20th century and prophesizes the fears of the 21st.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9537204/?ref_=tt_urv
16,20. It's a Wonderful Life,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0038650,"It's a Wonderful Life: A Timeless 9/10 Classic, Jimmy Stewart's Stellar Performance and Emotional Depth Make it a Cinematic Gem for Every Generation.","It's a Wonderful Life, a solid 9, man! This classic might be in black and white, but don't let that fool you - it's a timeless emotional journey. Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is iconic, capturing the struggles and triumphs of an everyday man. The plot, centered around the 'what if' scenario of George never being born, weaves a narrative that tugs at the heartstrings, making you reflect on the impact of one individual's life on an entire community.The supporting cast adds layers of depth, and Clarence the angel brings a quirky charm to the whole 'guardian angel' concept. The small-town setting oozes nostalgia, and the film's messages about family, friendship, and the value of a single life are powerful. Despite being an older film, the themes are relevant, and the storytelling remains captivating, leaving you with a warm and fuzzy feeling long after the credits roll.Sure, some might find it a bit sentimental, but that's the magic of 'It's a Wonderful Life.' It's a cinematic gem that not only stands the test of time but continues to resonate with audiences of all ages. A 9/10 because it's a heartwarming journey that reminds us of the profound impact our lives can have on those around us, and sometimes, it takes a bit of cinematic magic to appreciate the wonderfulness of life.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540888/?ref_=tt_urv
17,21. Shichinin No Samurai,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0047478,both sides have their own pain,"I thought I would think ""it was already amazing to be able to film like this back then,"" but after watching it, I realized that ""many directors, especially Chinese directors, cannot produce this kind of shooting effect today."" In 2019, I re watched this film and discovered many details. At the beginning of the story, I was looking for a samurai companion. When the master asked my disciple to attack the samurai with a wooden stick, several farmers quickly retreated. As the retreat was too natural, I had overlooked this detail in the past. However, this retreat action showed that the farmers shifted the responsibility onto the samurai (master) and did not want to bear the anger of the attacked samurai, even though they should be the main responsible person, not the master hired by them. There was also a disciple who secretly paid the farmers to buy rice, which was a gesture of gratitude. However, when the master considered that the disciple was young and did not allow him to participate in the fight, the farmers were eager for the disciple to join in. Of course, Akira Kurosawa does not have brainless black farmers. As Kikuchiyo said, although farmers are cunning and selfish, this is the character of farmers caused by the war of the samurai class. The samurai is very arrogant, the farmer is also very selfish, and both sides have their own pain. It is the farmer Kikuchiyo who wants to become a samurai who witnesses all of this.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540968/?ref_=tt_urv
18,22. Interstellar,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0816692,Mind-bending,"I am a Christopher Nolan fan by heart, though at the time of watching this film, I had only known of his work with respect to the 'Dark Knight' franchise. But after years of everyone around me telling me that 'Interstellar' is Nolan's masterpiece, I finally gave in. I will admit that the film does not leap out of the gates with intriguing premises, but it is instead a slow-rolling boulder of film that by the end has your jaw hanging as you attempt to wrap your mind around these concepts. I still could not tell you exactly what happens, but this film transcends scientific understanding and instead lets the decisions characters make speak for themselves. A true Nolan twist.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540036/?ref_=tt_urv
19,23. The Silence of the Lambs,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0102926,I need to watch this again,"I finished watching this movie and have spent over an hour trying to answer my lingering questions. This led me through a bunch of YouTube videos that broke down just how complex and layered this movie is with hidden messages that make it so incredible. I also ended up going through Reddit posts and finally got all the answers to my questions but not until I learned info from the book that's not in the movie. Without it, I'm not sure how the audience is expected to piece everything together. So this is absolutely a movie that I want to and need to watch again. On a second watch, I think there's a good chance I will love it so much more than I already do. But for now, I can only give it an 8 because I did have so many lingering questions after it. Moving on from that, what an incredible movie. The scene where we first see Lecter is one of the creepiest feelings I've ever had. The storytelling, especially from Clarice's perspective is incredibly and the relationship that unfolds between the two of them is fascinating. Also, my jaw was literally on the floor when I saw how Lecter escapes using the ambulance. So a really incredible movie, but one I need to watch again to be able to fully understand and appreciate even more.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540463/?ref_=tt_urv
20,24. Saving Private Ryan,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0120815,FUBAR,"I went into this movie knowing it's good and praised. It was still an amazing watch. One of finest collaboration between Mr. Hanks and Mr. Spielberg, *Saving Private Ryan,* still maintains its glorious status after many years. Its opening scene in Omaha Beach is probably the best war battle sequence of all time and its influence is ubiquitous in many war movies to come afterward. Its depiction of war is not sensationalized and it's almost too realistic. The fear that these soldiers felt can be felt through the screen as well. The next major battle sequence at the bridge was quite amazing too but the first opening scene was quite overwhelming.The story in between the battles is still interesting. The major theme around this movie concerns the morality of forming a search party for one man. To save private Ryan, many lives have been sacrificed. Lives lost vs lives saved is a key theme and just like the members of the search party, the audience can't help but question the morality of it all. It's a flawed mission from the start but also is justified by the unimaginable potential grief of losing all four sons to war. Other aspects of the story of how Captain Miller is a hardened but still anxious English teacher turned into leader on the war field. The story of Upham and his idea of morality during wartime is also something to ponder about. This movie is great because it doesn't depict these guys as heroes and most of them die anyways. They are just regular people caught in fires of war.Watching fine and well-crafted movies like this should all bring anti-war sentiments. There is nothing glorious about war. Although the movie starts and ends with the American flag, it is seen as a nod of respect for those who have perished in war rather than calling for more people on the battlefield. If the latter was the purpose, the Omaha beach scene would have been more glamorized. Chilling movie.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9531203/?ref_=tt_urv
