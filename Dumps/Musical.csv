1,37. The Lion King,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0110357,Superb,"I saw The Lion King when it was released in the cinema 30 years ago, yes that long ago! Funnily enough, right now I'm watching for the first time the Twilight Zone Lost Classics which was also released the same year as The Lion King, and believe it or not, the host of the Lost Classics is James Earl Jones, who also voiced
Mufasa in The Lion King. So James Earl Jones was quite busy in 1994.Anyway, I don't think The Lion King is for young kids as some scenes are quite scary and all. Anyway, I haven't seen the sequels, and I haven't seen the stage play but maybe I should because it's worthwhile.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9540268/?ref_=tt_urv
2,87. Singin' in the Rain,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0045152,10/10,"This was an absolute spectacular of a masterpiece of a film. The music was awesome in this film, and the way that they ended it was absolutely, without a doubt, perfection. I can probably vote that my favorite types of storylines are love stories now, and this will be because every love story I have ever witnessed had some beautiful storytelling and astonishing character development. This would mean that Don and Kathy's dynamic in this film was definitely one of the greatest in any film ever, and that is an absolute fact. As of right now, I will have to put this in my top 10, if not 5, favorite films of all time. Good job to Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521261/?ref_=tt_urv
3,115. Hamilton,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt8503618,Citizen who?,"I've spoke about this musical many times and I'm sure I will speak about it many more times. It is everything that's perfect in live. I've heard people trashing lin manuel miranda for his voucd but they're wrong. He sounds great. Davies dings and Renee elise Goldberg both have vocals that are out of this world.I heard a lot of people also complaining about how the casting is not true to the actors nationalty and to that I say who cares. Thomas jefferson, who was obviously a white man being played by daveed diggs was a brilliant choice and honestly he hard carried the second act. This is being written after my 9th watch but u can bet there will be a lot more. 10/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9448014/?ref_=tt_urv
4,230. The Wizard of Oz,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0032138,There's no place like home,"Every time I write about a musical (which is not often) I say this: I really don't care about them and neither do a bunch of other film fans. However, this movie is arguably the most famous one ever made so I am going to make an exception here. The Wizard of Oz was originally a kid's book from 1900, but is today mostly remembered as this beyond legendary movie which has its monumental reputation for a number of reasons. It utilized Technicolor at a time when few other films did in order to take full advantage of the grandiose fantasy setting, it had original and memorable characters, morals, and an unforgettable adventure. I don't think there's any person on Earth who hasn't seen this at least once, so explaining the plot might seem like an exercise in futility, but it's one of the greatest stories ever told. The movie begins with a rural teenage girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland) living on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt and Uncle. Dorothy's terrier, Toto, bites a rich woman named Almira, which leads to the latter wanting the dog to be put down. Toto is confiscated by Almira, but makes it back to Dorothy, and they run off together to escape Almira's wrath. Dorothy intends on running away, but meets a fraudulent fortune teller who tells Dorothy her aunt is sick and she must go home to her right away. She arrives back home just as a big tornado is about to demolish her house. She takes shelter in the house and is knocked out by violent winds as the tornado transports the house to what seems like another dimension. Dorothy wakes up in what is called Munchkinland which is part of the land of Oz. Tiny people (known as munchkins) are happy Dorothy's house is here as it just so happened to land on an evil witch named the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. The witch's sibling, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton), appears out of thin air in order to take back a pair of shiny ruby slippers which belonged to her sister. However, a benevolent witch named Glinda uses her magic to make Dorothy wear them. The Wicked Witch can't use her powers in a happy land like Munchkinland, so she is forced to leave, but tells Dorothy next time she won't be so lucky. Glinda instructs Dorothy to follow what is known as the Yellow Brick Road which leads into Emerald City, home to the Wizard of Oz and the person who will know how she can get back home. On the way there, Dorothy meets other outlandish characters, namely a Scarecrow, a metal man known as Tin Man, and a humanoid lion called The Cowardly Lion (Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively). As each one meets Dorothy, they agree to accompany her on her journey, as each of them wants to ask the Wizard for something they believe is important to them. The Tin Man wants a heart so he can feel human emotions, the Lion wants courage so he can stop being afraid, and the Scarecrow wants a brain. Upon reaching Emerald City, Dorothy is let in, but only after mentioning Glinda sent them. They meet with the Wizard, who says who will grant their wishes, but only if they're able to get the Wicked Witch's broomstick. Dorothy and her friends set out to infiltrate the Witch's secret fortress, but the Witch orders flying monkey servants she owns to capture Dorothy and Toto. The Witch locks Dorothy in a room of the castle and says if she doesn't give up the slippers, she will kill her dog. Toto manages to run off and alert Tin Man, The Lion and Scarecrow to Dorothy's trouble. The three disguise themselves as the Witch's soldiers and get into the castle. Tin Man uses his axe to break down the door Dorothy is locked behind, and they attempt to escape. They don't get very far before the huge swarms of soldiers surround them. The Wicked Witch sets her broom on fire and torches Scarecrow with it, leading Dorothy to extinguish him with a bucket of water. Some of the water gets onto the witch, who proceeds to melt and die. Dorothy says she didn't mean to kill her, but the Witch's own soldiers are glad she is finished and want Dorothy to take the broom to the Wizard. Arriving back in Oz's chamber, Dorothy presents him with the broom, but the Wizard doesn't uphold his end of the deal. He says to come back tomorrow. Toto pulls back a curtain in the corner of the chamber, revealing the Wizard to be nothing more than an ordinary guy operating a machine that projects a big, transparent image of his face. Angry at first for being lied to, Dorothy confronts the Wizard, but he grants the wishes of Tin Man, The Lion, and Scarecrow by giving them things that represent the traits they always wanted. The Lion gets a medal symbolizing his bravery, Tin Man gets a heart with a clock inside it, and Scarecrow is given a PhD. The Wizard then offers to fly Dorothy back to Kansas in a hot air balloon, but right before setting off, Toto jumps from the basket and Dorothy must run after him. She is left behind. Now depressed that she'll never get back home, Dorothy sees an orb of light approaching, which contains Glinda. The good witch says Dorothy had the ability to return to Kansas the whole time, but had to find that out for herself. All she has to do is tap her heels together with her eyes closed and say ""there's no place like home."" After saying bye to her friends, she does this and wakes up in her bed, her Aunt and Uncle standing nearby. The farm hands who work for her Aunt look exactly like her three friends from Oz, but they are convinced it was just a dream. This entire film from start to end is just pure magic. I might be wrong, but I really think it is the overall the most famous movie ever. Everything about it is basically perfect, and there's many reasons why it has stood the test of time for almost a century. The landscapes of Oz are just wondrous, and everything is so colorful it looks like you can reach out and touch it. Garland's portrayal of Dorothy is a masterpiece. While this film may basically define the word classic and is what most people think of when they imagine the golden age of movies, it would be nothing without her contributions. She doesn't pretend to be a hero on her quest, and only wants to see her family again. She doesn't even want revenge on the witch trying to sabotage her at every turn. She is in a big hurry to run away in the beginning for the safety of her dog, but by the end, she realizes home is the place where they're most safe. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch is great. She's menacing, and even though most people think of this as a kid's film, she is genuinely so good and creepy in her role that you can't take your eyes off her. She and the other characters have no doubt left permanent impressions on film fans for decades, and will continue to do so. As long as movies are a thing, I'm very confident that The Wizard of Oz will keep on being watched, praised and written about for generations. It is hard for me to say if this or Gone With the Wind is the all time iconic American movie, but it's so hard to choose between two masterpieces.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534232/?ref_=tt_urv
5,240. The Sound of Music,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0059742,Unique!,"Unique in that Marni Nixon is credited! She plays Sister Sophia, credited as herself, no less. No need to dub Julie Andrews, who apparently could sing! Who knew!60 years later and my 5 year old granddaughter already sings along. Definitely the loudest if not the most dulcet tones to be sure. Kind of the definition of a classic. I doubt her grandchildren will be singing along with Hamilton.This and other Roger's and Hammerstein classics define what it means to be a classic musical. While easy to to dismiss as fluff, it is based on a true story set in 1938 on the eve of the Nazis taking over Austria, and has Nazis, betrayal, escapes, life and death situations, hiding behind it's musical scrim. The music and lyrics range from filler to carry the story along, to songs that became American Standards. ""Edelweiss"" is so well written many assume it is the actual national anthem of Austria. There are several story lines, both young children and their parents can watch the movie and leave the theatre having experienced completely different movies. Several scenes could be stressful for young children, in stark contrast to the movies general lighthearted theme. Each time I watch, a hidden gem reveals itself, worth a 30th or 40th viewing for sure. Note the stage musical and the movie version are not the same, the movie version reorders the original, and eliminates a couple of songs. Though not as extreme as the stage and movie versions of ""Chicago"" for example. That said I find Robert Wises version to be the superior production. Enjoy!",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9533636/?ref_=tt_urv
6,249. Aladdin,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0103639,one of the best cartoons of disney,This is one of the best cartoons of disney. Aladdin a beggard who falls in-loved with a princess. Gets a magic lamp and a flying carpet and sings like a prince. The princess sings well too which makes a wonderful story.
