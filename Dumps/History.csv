1,6. Schindler's List,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0108052,The profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust,"""Schindler's List"" is a profound testament to the horrors of the Holocaust and an ode to the power of individual conscience and compassion in the face of unfathomable evil. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a hauntingly poignant portrayal of one man's transformation from opportunist to savior amidst the atrocities of World War II.The story follows Oskar Schindler, a German businessman brilliantly portrayed by Liam Neeson, who initially seeks to profit from the war by employing Jewish labor in his factories. However, as he witnesses the systematic persecution and genocide of Jews under Nazi rule, Schindler undergoes a moral awakening. His efforts to save the lives of over a thousand Jewish workers, guided by his accountant Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley), become an act of defiance against the inhumanity of the Holocaust.Spielberg's direction captures the harrowing realities of the Holocaust with unflinching authenticity, employing black and white cinematography to evoke a haunting sense of history. The film's stark visuals, coupled with John Williams' haunting score, create an emotionally immersive experience that leaves an indelible impact on the audience.What sets ""Schindler's List"" apart is its unwavering portrayal of both the depths of human cruelty and the glimmer of hope found in acts of altruism. It's a narrative that confronts the darkest chapters of history while honoring the resilience and humanity of those who resisted.The performances, especially Neeson's portrayal of Schindler's gradual transformation from a profiteer to a savior, resonate with emotional depth. The supporting cast adds layers of authenticity to the characters, showcasing the resilience and tragedy of those caught in the Holocaust's grip.Beyond its cinematic achievements, ""Schindler's List"" serves as a powerful educational tool, a stark reminder of the consequences of hate and the importance of standing up against injustice. Its impact extends far beyond the screen, challenging viewers to confront the atrocities of the past and champion compassion and tolerance in the present.Decades after its release, the film remains a cinematic landmark-a testament to the filmmaker's dedication to preserving history and telling stories that transcend entertainment, leaving an enduring legacy as a powerful, emotionally raw portrayal of one of humanity's darkest chapters.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534449/?ref_=tt_urv
2,68. Oppenheimer,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt15398776,Complicated Theatrical Rendition of a Complicated Individual,"With Oppenheimer, his first biopic, writer/director Christopher Nolan once again proves he's up to the challenge of balancing a difficult subject matter with a very tricky character piece. The slow, careful process of scientific discovery is rarely friendly to film, and shy, socially-awkward introverts do not often make for compelling leads, but in this case Nolan juggles both and steps away smelling like roses. As he'd already done on more than one occasion, in decidedly different flavors.Here we track the career of a famed theoretical physicist, thrust into the limelight as the so-called ""father of the atom bomb"" during the crush of World War 2 and then dismissed by an ungrateful government after he'd outlived his usefulness and started asking difficult follow-up questions. Oppenheimer's frustrated early career, meteoric rise to fame and equally rapid fall from grace are depicted almost simultaneously, in a rush of confused, overlapped memories. This style of all-at-once storytelling, in which foreshadowing coexists with its own outcome, is reminiscent of the time-blurred motifs we've already seen in Tenet, Inception and Dunkirk. Here it serves as a compelling way to digest a lot of information in a very short amount of time, especially when paired with a head-spinning series of metaphorical visual effects and an entrancing musical score. I've read the book this film was based upon, a daunting 800-page tome, and after the first hour I felt like I'd just read most of it all over again. This time with a little extra dramatic pizazz.It's an impressive display of top-notch filmmaking, proficiently depicting a historical scenario in which everyone already knows the ending and climaxing with a tense, powerful visualization of the Trinity tests which first loosed the power of violent nuclear fission upon the world. I loved every moment, but then, I was already deeply invested in the subject and had done some homework. My wife, far less prepared, was also far less enchanted. I think this may be more of a knock on Oppenheimer the man than Oppenheimer the film. A complicated, often misguided individual who, for all his brilliance within the hidden world of molecular physics, was inherently flawed and broken in a human sense. Nolan makes no apology for this, baring the person (and his many blemishes) to the screen with no filter, and the results aren't always pretty.Perhaps a bit too long, especially in the painfully bitter, sixty-minute postscript, but I'm not sure where I'd want to see a cut. Certainly not a feel-good audience pleaser, Nolan's latest is an exhausting experience, but also rich, thoughtful and rewarding.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9541184/?ref_=tt_urv
3,78. Braveheart,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0112573,It's a Subjective Thing,"The Academy loves awarding splashy historical flicks with good stories about people living for ideals with Best Pucture Oscars. ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Chariots of Fire,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and, of course, ""Braveheart.""Most of them touch real history at points, though history is always more nuanced than streamlined stories invented by Hollywood, which is the home if money-grubbing big business which occasionally turns out a masterpiece that seems to undermine the values it dotes on.""Braveheart"" is a good movie as, like the others I named, it doesn't feel like it's real length. It moves at a cracking pace.The movie is full of solid performances from Gibson, Sophie Marceau, Patrick McGoohan and others.Some of these historical movies are more historical than others. ""Amadeus"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"" are truly great movies that look beautiful and have great performances but are barely on nodding acquaintences with history. ""Amadeus,"" like ""Lawrence"" and ""Chariots,"" is one of my favorites and I watch it a lot more often.""Braveheart"" is right in there slugging with the best of them.So why do I hate it? Not because the history is nonsense. No historical movie is less historical than ""Shakespeare in Love."" Sure, there's no bridge at the battle of Sterling Bridge and the Scots are fighting in kilts (kilts!) rather than armor, ya-da ya-da, but I'm not offended by the line in SIL where the guy playing the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" tells a woman he's chatting up, ""It's about this nurse . . ."" I'm not offended by Peter O'Toole having half a foot or more on the real T. E. Lawrence; or the mis-identification of Harold Abrahams' G&S singing girlfriend; or the fact that Saliere didn't kill Mozart and was 100 miles away when Mozart died.Perhaps it's a long-time personal antipathy I have toward Gibson. I admire his courage in presenting ""The Passion of the Christ"" (a much better historical movie, albeit not in English). But I simply don't see his charm, from the time my brother and I watched the first ""Mad Max"" flick on TV.I remember an evening a good friend of mine suggested we have a double feature where we each had to watch the others' choices. It was a Mel Gibson evening. She selected ""What Women Want"" and I got ""Chicken Run."" We hated each other's movies. But I didn't mind Gibson in my choice when I couldn't see the guy.Anyway, take all the good things I said about this movie. As a fictional story (like ""Amadeus"") it's acceptable. But though I love tales of people fighting for freedom (which is why I love American history, an ongoing fight for freedom since 1776) I haven't watched this once since I saw it in the theatre nearly 30 years ago. I've been tempted, since I love McGoohan's acting and Sophie was never more beautiful; but I've resisted the temptation.At least, for its length, like the other movies I mentioned, it's never dull. It leaves me cold but that's a subjective thing. If you're indifferent toward Gibson, you might want to watch ""Chicken Run"" instead.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9531241/?ref_=tt_urv
4,115. Hamilton,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt8503618,Citizen who?,"I've spoke about this musical many times and I'm sure I will speak about it many more times. It is everything that's perfect in live. I've heard people trashing lin manuel miranda for his voucd but they're wrong. He sounds great. Davies dings and Renee elise Goldberg both have vocals that are out of this world.I heard a lot of people also complaining about how the casting is not true to the actors nationalty and to that I say who cares. Thomas jefferson, who was obviously a white man being played by daveed diggs was a brilliant choice and honestly he hard carried the second act. This is being written after my 9th watch but u can bet there will be a lot more. 10/10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9448014/?ref_=tt_urv
5,125. Der Untergang,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0363163,This is a must-watch movie...,"With his 2004 movie ""Der Untergang"" (aka ""Downfall""), director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered quite an amazing movie. This is such a hard-hitting movie and one that most definitely deserves to be seen, regardless of you having an interest in World War II or not. Why? Well, because it is a powerful story and one that proves that history must never be forgotten.Writer Bernd Eichinger put together a powerful and memorable script and story, based on the books by Joachim Fest, Traudl Junge and Melissa MÃ¼ller. The storyline told in ""Der Untergang"" is one that will stick with you for a long time.I am really amazed with the storytelling in ""Der Untergang"", because director Oliver Hirschbiegel takes the audience along on a very emotional journey throughout the 156 minutes that the movie runs for. You might think that 156 minutes is a long runtime, but it actually is not, because the story is so nicely told, so interesting and so encompassing that you just get swept up and carried along the narrative as it unfolds and shows the last days of the regime of Adolf Hitler and the end of his Third Reich.Leading actor Bruno Ganz, playing Adolf Hitler, puts on such an amazing performance in this movie that it is hard not to be impressed. Bruno Ganz's performance in ""Der Untergang"" is so powerful that his performance alone makes the movie well-worth watching. In fact, the entire cast ensemble in the movie put on great performances individually, and that really added so much to the overall presentation of the movie.""Der Untergang"" is a movie that leaves quite an impression upon the viewer.And the fact that everything is kept in German, and some Russian language as well, makes it all the more believable and authentic. If this movie was dubbed, it would be an affront to writer Bernd Eichinger and director Oliver Hirschbiegel.The costume and props departments worked their magic to make ""Der Untergang"" look and feel like a proper World War II movie, which definitely was a crucial factor for the overall impact of the movie. It looks and feels the way it is supposed to, and that kind of authenticism really makes all the difference.If you haven't already seen ""Der Untergang"", then you most certainly should do so, should you get the chance. This is a must-watch movie.My rating of ""Der Untergang"" lands on a nine out of ten stars.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9521153/?ref_=tt_urv

7,183. 12 Years a Slave,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2024544,Barbaric,"Being a slave was barbaric enough. Even worse to be a free man first and be enslaved by a vicious kidnapping. Leaving your beloved family behind and not knowing if you will ever see them again. Terribly inhumane!In this heartbreaking movie, we see not only some of the horrors that people of color had to endure, but most certainly the perseverance of my people. In this heartbreaking film, we not only see some of the horrors that people of color have had to endure, but also the perseverance of my people.For anyone who finds themselves in a difficult position, choose a motivation, such as Solomon. He wanted to see his family again at all costs. With the right motivation, you can handle anything. You don't know how strong you are until being strong is the only option you have.As a filmmaker of color, I mainly take with me the perseverance of Solomon Northup.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9531036/?ref_=tt_urv
8,190. Hacksaw Ridge,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt2119532,Great WWII story,"The story fits nicely into 3 acts, the introduction, the training and finally the combat sequences. The real strength of the film lies in it's final act, the direction is superb as we the audience are hurled into the hell of battle, all it's trauma, fear, brutality and horror. I couldn't think of a single bad performance and the supporting cast are all actually quite well developed given the limited time we have to get to know them. The story is about Desmond Doss a straight-talking high minded individual who simultaneously pursues a romantic engagement and tries to enlist in the army while refusing to take up arms, wishing instead to serve as a medic. He freely admits to being a consciousness objector, his convictions are of course mistaken for cowardice and every obstacle is thrown in front of him in an effort to get him out.The film course boasts very high production values and the close quarter fighting sequences have to be seen to be believed. I fully recommend the Blu Ray experience despite the dull colour scheme in the third act, with it's grey, brown and green colours, together with it's smoky backdrop and handheld camera work the visuals none the less are atoningly good. In close ups every scratch on a helmet is Clearly seen as is every tiny speck of dried blood on a person's forehead. The art department deserve full credit for their work. The score is what you'd expect from this genera of film of war and heroism and the sound design is probably more important than the visuals in portraying the terrors of battle. The only moment shots which looked a little unreal were the CGI ships of the US navy, other than that everything seems to blend seamlessly. Another slight problem is that in the chaos of the fast paced fighting it's hard to tell who is who.Films these days about war often like to explore the grey areas, the moral challenges it presents to a characters ideas of right or wrong, Fury being one such example.. It's refreshing then for a film to be coming back with a sense that personal values and convictions can withstand the grim reality of war. It could also be seen as a challenge to secular ideas that religious objections should carry little to no weight in the eyes of the law and it's country. Desmond was able to make an incredible personal contribution exactly because his beliefs were made allowance for.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9514074/?ref_=tt_urv
9,215. Hotel Rwanda,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0395169,Brilliant film of questionable factual basis,"I'm aware that there are substantial claims that the depiction of Paul Rusesabagina is potentially flawed in this film and that he may not be the hero the movie makes him out to be. I can't know for sure which version of the story is factual and can only ""review"" the film as presented.The movie is powerful and heartbreaking and shows the 1994 genocide of Tutsis by rival Hutus as part of the Rwandan Civil War. The horrifying brutality of this unimaginable slaughter of up to 800,000 people is the backdrop for the valiant efforts of a resort hotel manager to shelter and save as many innocents as possible, especially children. I CAN say that Don Cheadle is outstanding in the film, that the movie accurately and dramatically gives an eye-opening look at the savagery of war, and is absolutely worth watching as presented. I would also urge people (if interested) to read further on the subject to decide for themselves whether they believe this story, as told, to be mostly factual or a slanted and unfair view of history.The film itself deserves a ""9"" or maybe even a ""10"" on merit. I've given it an ""8"" because the controversy over its veracity troubles me. I still highly recommend.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9435538/?ref_=tt_urv
10,219. La passion de Jeanne d'Arc,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0019254,The Passion of Joan of Arc,"To ensure King Charles rise to the throne, supported by the apparently divine guidance given to Joan of Arc, is discredited, the captured Joan must be found guilty of heresy. This classic silent film chronicles the endless tricks and misdirection employed by the church to gain Joan's confession so she can be burned alive as a heretic.At nearly 100 years old this is a considerable achievement, noted for its pretty much constant close ups on Joan her persecutors, so that instead of chronicling courtroom action you instead see the pain, anguish and anger in the faces of those involved. At the centre of this is of course RenÃ©e Jeanne Falconetti as Joan, giving, in close up, a stonking performance even by today's standards. The whole drama is moving and equally frustrating as God's priests on earth slowly but surely decide she must burn. This notorious climactic scene is itself impressively handled and broadened out from just close ups with the actual execution, poignantly and incredibly realistically staged. One you have to see if you love cinema.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9439116/?ref_=tt_urv
