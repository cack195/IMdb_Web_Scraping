2,165. Raging Bull,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0081398,Robert De Niro delivers his finest performance in an average film!,"The movie about this super aggressive boxer is a winner only because of an impeccable performance by De Niro. He makes you dislike him, want to kill him, hate him, empathise him and not understand him at all.You live this character while watching Raging Bull. A perfect title for not a perfect film.The story is predictable from scene 3 onwards.It's easy to understand the kind of life this man was designing for himself.I have never been a De Niro fan but this movie kind of made me a big fan.That man knows his craft so well, and doesn't shy away from taking up any role.Watch this to see acting at a big level.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9534836/?ref_=tt_urv

4,179. Million Dollar Baby,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0405159,Great cinema!,"Multi layered story, excellent actors and brilliant acting. An uppercut to the stomach that takes your breath away. This movie, so intense, captivates you and it's difficult to tear yourself away from.Shot in a short time with rather little budget, talks about respect, tells how life and death are held together by suffering and captures the magic of risking everything for a dream that no one sees except you.""Beyond his silence, there is a past. Beyond her dreams, there is a feeling. Beyond hope, there is a memory. Beyond their journey, there is a love.""Excellent performances, bright direction: rough and heartfelt. ""It's a downer... but it's gorgeous.""",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9517214/?ref_=tt_urv
5,181. Bacheha-Ye Aseman,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt0118849,A Most Uplifting and Unique Experience!,"It's easy to understand why there are OVER 200 reviews of ""Children of Heaven"". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I'm sure many others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all those who would listen!After watching ""Children"", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn't like!This film celebrates youth, the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to any American film that makes an effort along these lines, regrettably, seems rather empty and almost laughable in comparison. The sibling rivalry so familiar
to us in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review like this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks!I feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed too often as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. And to make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is more often than not viewed as copasetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate!Some people have commented that ""Children"" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie ...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA! 10***********",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9465736/?ref_=tt_urv
6,208. Ford v. Ferrari,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1950186,Absolute masterpiece,"Absolutely excellent. The film begins with Carroll Shelby at the helm of a race car at Le Man's. The movie quick identifies why he can no longer race for himself, and transiting into his business. The movie has nearly non- stop racing action, and manages to make all of the drama of the business endeavors as exciting as pinning the throttle down the Mulsanne straight.There is no limit of technical details, as the movie covers how the GT40 engineers overcame each pitfall of the car. You get to enjoy the progress of the vehicle, the racing, and Shelby as a brand.The acting is spot on, and the cast clearly has chemistry behind the scenes that makes this movie as great as it is.I've watched this movie with people that have no in- depth knowledge of cars, engineering, or any characters. Unanimously, the film comes through in every way you could want.My only want, is that more movies are made just like this one.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9520820/?ref_=tt_urv

8,223. Rush,https://www.imdb.com//title/tt1979320,The real story of famous racers,"The 2013 ""Rush"" from director Ron Howard is a high-quality and soulful film that demonstrates the exciting story, adrenaline of Formula 1 racing and human drama. This picture was even nominated in the Best Film category at the Golden Globe Awards, but lost to the film 12 Years a Slave. A serious opponent who could not be bypassed. Nevertheless, Howard's project became a memorable work in the careers of all involved.In the ""Rush"", the excellent acting and successful directorial vision create a rich and exciting world. Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda go beyond the simple embodiment of the characters, and their characters come to life. Charismatic characters allow the viewer to feel the inner fire of rivalry and passion for victory.Hemsworth, known for his appearance and charm, convincingly conveys the passion and audacity of his character, creating an image of an intriguing and often uncomfortable hero for others. Involuntarily, a comparison with the famous hero Thor, whom Hemsworth has been playing for many years, suggests itself. Here, under the appearance of Thor, there is a completely different character, into which the actor has so successfully reincarnated. Chris's excellent performance, a worthy role that will forever remain in his career as one of the strongest.Daniel Bruhl as Niki Lauda perfectly conveys the character of this legendary racer. His acting work is characterized by precision and depth, revealing not only Lauda's professional qualities, but also his inner world, including difficult moments in his personal life.The script of the film is masterfully written, paying attention not only to racing and high speed, but also to the deep human relationships underlying the story. This balance between competition and friendship creates a touching and exciting aspect that manages to be conveyed in every frame.Technically, the painting was created with great care. Decent editing and soundtrack give the film a special status, taking it to a new level, especially in the racing scenes, where the viewer almost physically feels the speed and adrenaline.Especially impressive is the attention to detail in the visual design of the film, recreating the style of the 1970s. Costumes, cars, scenery - everything embodies the atmosphere of that era and gives the film a unique character. And the color correction is deliberately specially selected in such a way that the viewer feels like he is watching a 1970s movie.But, of course, one of the main achievements of the ""Rush"" is the exciting racing scenes. They not only immerse the viewer into the world known even to people who are not interested in Formula 1, but also convey the extreme sensations and risks associated with this sport.Ron Howard's compositional work is an art that can pull the viewer into the dynamic world of race tracks and at the same time remain true to the deep human aspects of the story. The director's vision of the director deserves the highest praise. He expertly handles Peter Morgan's script, immersing the viewer in the intriguing world of Formula 1 and at the same time paying attention to human relationships. Howard emphasizes emotional moments and moves from exciting racing scenes to deep reflections of the characters with ease, as if playfully, not allowing the viewer to understand where the transition from action to drama and back happens.The director not only gives the viewer the opportunity to feel the adrenaline of racing, but also delves into the psychology and motivation of the characters. He carefully balanced the dynamic racing moments with the touching and meaningful scenes between Hunt and Lauda, creating a harmonious piece.The painting is remembered for another important aspect - the work of Hans Zimmer. It has long been no secret to me that the projects to which the composer puts his hand are literally doomed to success. I love Zimmer's music, and it's very good here. The musical work in the film adds an additional layer of emotional saturation and enhances the visual range.Hans Zimmer, known for his unique style and sense of rhythm, created a soundtrack that perfectly matches the dynamics of the racing scenes and at the same time skillfully emphasizes the internal conflicts of the characters. His compositions in the film seem to become a separate character who actively interacts with the plot and conveys subtle interweaving of emotions. The picture is not limited only to visual and acting aspects, but also includes the musical magic of Hans Zimmer.""Rush"" is not just an ordinary film about professionals driving, of which there are probably a dozen. This is a great real story about friendship, passion, overcoming oneself and difficulties. Director Ron Howard has created a work that can delight and inspire, even those who are not fans of the world of racing. The painting is still remembered with interest, even a decade after viewing. This is an exciting journey that leaves an indelible impression and causes deep admiration for the work of the entire team, and, most importantly, opens up the real stories of Niki Lauda and James Hunt for the average viewer.9 out of 10.",https://www.imdb.com//review/rw9519852/?ref_=tt_urv
